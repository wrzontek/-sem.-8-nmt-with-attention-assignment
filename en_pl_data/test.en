We're asked to multiply 65 times 1.
"So literally, we just need to multiply 65-- we could write"
it is a times sign like that or we could write it as a dot
like that-- but this means 65 times 1.
And there's two ways to interpret this.
You could view this as the number 65 one time or you
could view this as the number 1 sixty-five
"times, all added up."
"But either way, if you have one 65, this is literally just"
going to be 65.
"Anything times 1 is going to be that anything,"
whatever this is.
"So if I have 3 times 1, I'm going to get 3."
"If I have 5 times 1, I'm going to get 5, because literally,"
all this is saying is 5 one time.
"If I put-- I don't know-- 157 times 1, that'll be 157."

There's nothing subtle about 17th century Dutch genre painting. 
So often we're shown interactions that are wonderfully bawdy and wonderfully explicit. 
"There is an exception, however: Jan Vermeer's paintings often are riddles, they give us suggestions of narratives. "
"And in this painting it's true, we're not really sure exactly what's about to unfold. "
What we're seeing is a man who is still wearing his hat and outer cloak. 
"He stands beside a table with a beautiful carpet on it, and he has his hand on a jug of wine. "
He looks like he's ready to refill the young woman's glass. 
She's got it up to her mouth and she's just finishing it off. 
"Well, and he looks impatient to pour her another glass, as though the goal of this whole interaction is to get her drunk. "
"But across from her, at the window that is ajar, "
"we can actually see a rendering in the stained glass of temperance, of moderation, in a sense an instruction to her to watch her step. "
"And so the painting is about possibility, it's about her choice, and the man whose face is shadowed by his hat is a little bit sinister in that way. "
"There's a sense of distance between the two figures, a sense that they're not terribly familiar with one another "
and I almost wonder whether the wine is gonna make that happen. 
"One of the reasons that the flirtation doesn't have an opportunity to be represented is because he's in shadow, we can just barely make out his eyes "
and her eyes are completely obscured by the shine in the beautifully delicate glass that she holds in front of her face. 
"She can't speak now, she's drinking, and she can't even see behind that glass, or at least, we can't see. "
"And yet that shine is all about vision, and it's held right at her eyes. "
"This is an early Vermeer, but already we can see his fascination with soft light: look at the way it infuses the space, comes through that blue curtain "
"and the delicacy that he's lavished on the tonality of the back wall and the other forms in this room, it's just spectacular. "
"Well, Vermeer is interested in light. We also have that characteristic geometry in the composition: "
"the square of the window that's open, "
"the rectangle of the frame on the back wall, "
"the square on the back of the chair, "
and the squares that move back and the perspective on the floor. 
"There is this kind of checkerboard pattern that does create a clear, structured interior, and then we have objects that are placed askew of that "
"so, you've got the line the window should trace, but the window is open, so that there's a diagonal that interrupts it. "
"You've got the careful rectilinear tiles on the floor but then you've got the chair, again, that's at an angle, and is offset from it. "
In some ways this painting is about the disruption of order 
and the way objects are placed in this space are about the tension that's created when things are not aligned. 
Perhaps that functions of a kind of metaphor for the interaction between the two figures. 
Or a kind of foreboding about what may happen. 
There are ways that the figures are linked. 
"Look at the concentric rings that fall from the man: you have his collar, "
then you've got a series of folds in the drapery that catch the light and sort of expand as they move down towards his arm. 
"And then that motion is picked up by the beautiful gold brocade in the woman's dress, and then the folds on her hip. "
"And so there really is a kind of harmony between those figures, and in some ways this painting is about harmony and disharmony, it's about alignment and things being askew. "
"And that's also symbolized in the musical instrument which is used in Vermeer's paintings to suggest both harmony and frivolity, so which way is this gonna go? "
I'm not sure! I think Vermeer is leaving that question open for the viewer. 
"By leaving this question open, Vermeer creates an image that is really poetic. "

"We need to evaluate the limit, as x approaches infinity, of 4x "
"squared minus 5x, all of that over 1 minus 3x squared. "
So infinity is kind of a strange number. 
You can't just plug in infinity and see what happens. 
"But if you wanted to evaluate this limit, what you might try "
to do is just evaluate-- if you want to find the limit as this 
"numerator approaches infinity, you put in really large numbers "
"there, and you're going to see that it approaches infinity. "
That the numerator approaches infinity as 
x approaches infinity. 
"And if you put really large numbers in the denominator, "
"you're going to see that that also-- well, "
not quite infinity. 
"3x squared will approach infinity, but we're "
subtracting it. 
So this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches
infinity of 4 minus 5 over x over 1 over x squared minus 3.
And what's this going to be equal to?
"Well, as x approaches infinity-- 5 divided by"
infinity-- this term is going to be 0.
"Super duper infinitely large denominator,"
this is going to be 0.
That is going to approach 0.
And same argument.
This right here is going to approach 0.
All you're left with is a 4 and a negative 3.
"negative 3, or negative 4/3."
So you didn't have to do use L'Hopital's Rule
for this problem.

[Norvig] And the answer is that all 3 of them would work just fine. 
We could make it work in all cases. 
It makes the necessary distinction. 
"And in each of these cases, the entries in this column "
"are greater than the entries in this column, "
and so max could do the job. 
But it seems to me that the case with tuples is the most convenient. 
Here with these integers or reals we'd have to be doing very complicated arithmetic 
to add things up and then break them apart to make sure we got the right answer. 
But with the tuples it's simple. 
We just use a comma operator. 
"We say start with a 7, add in what we have 4 of a kind in, "
"add in what we have the remaining 1 card of, and that gives you the 3 values, "
and we don't have to deal with any complicated arithmetic. 
"Now, if you aren't familiar with tuples, you might want a little bit of practice "
to understand how they work. 
"We said that 7, 9, 5 is greater than 7, 3, 2. "
"So in other words, this expression is a true expression in Python. "
And the way the evaluation works is you first look at the first element. 
"If one of them is greater, then that element is greater. "
"If they're the same, then you go on to the second element. "
"So in this case, 7 is equal to 7 so we move on. "
"9 is greater than 3, and so that means this guy is greater than that guy. "
You may have seen a similar type of thing in ordering between strings. 
"So we can have the string 'hello' and compare that to the string 'help', "
and we do it in exactly the same way that we compare tuples. 
We go left to right. 
"H compares to h. They're the same, so we move on to the next character. "
"E compares to e. They're the same, so we move on to the next. "
L is equal to l. Move on. 
"And here we have an l and a p, and p comes later in the alphabet than l, "
"so help would be greater than hello, or hello would be less than help. "
"The same type of idea, and this is known as lexigraphic ordering. "
It's so called because lex meaning words. 
This is the way that words are ordered. 
But we use the same name when we're comparing strings 
or when we're comparing lists of numbers or lists of any other type of value.

Multiply and express as a simplified rational. 
State the domain. 
We'll start with the domain. 
The only numbers that will make this expression undefined 
"are the ones that would make the denominator equal to 0, "
"and those are the situation, or that situation would occur, "
"when either a, b, x, or y is equal to 0. "
"If any of those are equal to 0, then we have an undefined "
expression. 
"We could say the domain is all real a's, b's, x, "
"and y's, except 0. "
"Or we could be specific: except a, b, x, and y can't "
equal to 0. 
"Or you could write this: given that a, b, x, and y does not "
"equal 0, that none of them can be equal to 0. "
These are just multiple ways of stating the same thing. 
"With that stated, let's actually multiply and simplify "
this rational expression. 
"So when we multiply, you just multiply the numerator and "
"multiply the denominator, so you have 3x squared y times "
14a squared b in the numerator. 
"Then in the denominator, we have 2ab times 18xy squared. "
Let's see where we can simplify this thing. 
"We can divide the 14 by 2, and the 2 by 2, and we get 14 "
"divided by 2 is 7, and 2 divided by 2 is 1. "
"We could divide the 3 by 3 and get 1, and divide the 18 "
"by 3, and get 6. "
Every time we divided the numerator and the denominator 
"by 2, now the numerator and the denominator by 3, so we're "
not changing the expression. 
"Then we can divide a squared divided by a, so you're just "
"left with an a in the numerator, and a divided "
by a is just 1. 
You have a b over a b. 
Those guys cancel each other out. 
"You have an x squared divided by an x, so x squared divided "
"by x is x, and x divided by x is just a 1, so this becomes "
"an x over 1, or just an x. "
"Finally, you have a y over a y squared. "
if. 
"You divide the numerator by y, you get 1. "
"If you divide the denominator by y, you just get a y, and so "
what are we left with? 
"We're left with in the numerator, "
these 1's we can ignore. 
That doesn't really change the number. 
We have a 7 times a times x. 
That's what we have in the numerator. 
"In the denominator, we just have a 6y. "
"And we have to add the constraint that a, b, x, and y "
cannot equal 0. 
"When you just look at this expression right here, you're "
"like, hey, what's wrong with x? "
"There isn't even any b here, so it's a little bit of a "
"bizarre statement, but you say, hey, why can't x or a be "
equal to 0 over here? 
It doesn't make it undefined. 
But in order for these to really be the same 
"expressions, they have to have the same domains. "
"Or actually, if these were functions that equal them, in "
order for that f of x to be equal to this f of x right 
"over here, you'd have to constrain the domain in a "
similar way. 
This is a fundamentally different expression if you 
allow x's and a's. 
"In this one, you can't allow x's and a's. "
"For them to be really the same, you have to put the same "
constraints on it.

The content is then added to Corel CONNECT. 
Any content back to X3 can be added 
to the Corel CONNECT libraries. 
You can also search other folders. 
e.g. 'My Documents' then 'My Pictures'. 
In 'Libraries' there are now extra libraries. 
"iStockphoto, Fotolia & Flicker. "
First open of CONNECT will display this red symbol. 
Click the symbol to access that providers details. 
Then click the activate button. It's important 
you read the Terms of Service. 
"Each provider has terms to be agreed to, "
be sure to read the terms through

The results being displayed now 
are from the X5 content and Flicker. 
Using CONNECT is very convenient for finding 
any type of content for a project. 
I'm now searching the word 'fruit'. 
The results contain vector images 
and bitmap images. 
If there is a vector image that 
you would like as Pattern fill image. 
Right-click & choose [Install as a vector pattern]. 
Remember in CorelDRAW you can go to fill and 
[Pattern fill] & then from the options 
choose a Vector Pattern Fill option. 
Installing this vector image 
makes it available as a Vector Pattern Fill. 
Use these option buttons here to filter results. 
For now I only want to see bitmap images. 
Filtering results can make searching easier. 
Bitmap images can be installed as Bitmap patterns. 
"Right-click & choose [Install as a bitmap pattern], "
It will be available from the Fill menu in CorelDRAW. 
Using the right-click menu on search results is useful. 
Your operating system & installed programs will determine 
what is displayed in this menu. 
Copy and Paste are very useful from within CONNECT. 
It means CONNECT can be used to find resources 
for any program that an image can be Paste into. 
It's is a very helpful program. 
"From my right-click menu I can even email an image, "
"print an image, or open the image in a program. "
To create a brand new tray. 
Click the tray menu and choose [Add new tray]. 
"To rename, right-click on the Tray & choose Rename. "
I will now search the word 'fish'. 
I am now going to find some fish for my next 
project and drag the images onto this new tray.. 
The next videos will follow on from this video 
So I'm going to select some suitable images 
to start the next video with. 
I require bright colourful images. 
"I also saved an image in 'My Pictures', "
this image here of a couple of fish. 
This will probably be the image I will use. 
I now have a number of choices for the next video. 
This fish Tray will be available in CorelDRAW 
when I open for the next project. 
Let me demonstrate. 
I'm going to open CorelDRAW. 
here in CorelDRAW click 'Search content'. 
"On first open, the Connect docker will open un-docked. "
Dock where ever is convenient for you. 
"To show the Trays, click the 'Show/hide' button. "
I'm going to close down this part of the docker. 
There are a few ways to work with the Trays. 
Un-dock the Trays and move around. 
The Trays can be resized to suit your work flow. 
"I am going to place it here, however I usually "
work with two screens & place it on the other screen. 
The Trays can be renamed at any time. 
A new feature found in X6 is very useful. 
To demonstrate I will paste some graphics here. 
This feature is great for introducing graphics from 
another file into your working document. 
Using this feature I can introduce the contents of 
A file without losing the position of those contents. 
Here's what to do. 
Assume this car is in the other document. 
Right-click & choose [Import at original position] 
The graphics are imported into this document 
maintaining their original positions. 
It’s a fantastic feature! 
The existing graphics are of course not affected. 
Click the minimise button on the Tray 
and it breaks down into a tool bar. 
It's very handy for small screen space. 
Click maximize to re-dock the trays 
or double click to return. 
Click on a tray to select it. 
I’m now going to move to the next project. 
In the next project I'll use this tray & graphics 
and I'll start on the subject of Page Layout.

"In the last video we had a three-dimensional surface,"
where the height z was a function of x and y.
And it gave us surface in three-dimensional space.
Now let's try to get our heads around what the gradient
of a function of three variables looks like.
So the easiest one for me to imagine is a scalar field.
So what's a scalar field?
One that I find fairly intuitive is temperature in
a three-dimensional room.
So let's say the temperature in a room is a function of
where I am in the room.
"So let's say it's a function of my x, y, and z coordinates."
"And I don't know, I have never actually modeled temperature."
"But let's say I have, I don't know, a 20 kelvin-- actually,"
let me make it so that our vector field works out right.
Let's say we have a 10 kelvin heat force in
the center of our room.
I can imagine as you go further and further away from that
So let's say that the temperature function.
And let's say that center of the room is at the coordinates
"x, y, and z is equal to 0."
So let's say our temperature function-- I'm just making this
"up, I don't know if this is an accurate model of temperature--"
it's equal to 10 times e to the minus r squared.
Now why did I say r?
"I said it's a function of x, y, and z."
Well I'm just saying that it exponentially decays as you
get further and further away from that source.
Kind of radially further and further away from that source.
So what's the radial distance away?
"And this actually isn't that relevant to learning gradients,"
but let's get a little intuition about what that
actual temperature function-- how it actually changes as
you go through the room.
"So the radius away from the center, that's just going to be"
r squared is just x squared plus y squared plus z squared.
That's just the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.
So let's write our temperature function.
"So let's write temperature as a function of x, y, and z is"
equal to 10 e to the minus x squared plus y squared plus z
squared-- which is exactly what I wrote up here.
"Instead of x squared plus y squared plus z squared, I wrote"
"r squared, just to kind of give you the intuition that this"
expression is just saying the square of the distance as we
"coordinate 0, 0, 0."
But that's not what we're learning here.
"But I want you to understand, at least conceptualize this,"
it's hard to draw a scalar field.
All a scalar field means is that in any point in this
base-- and in this case we're dealing with three-dimensional
space-- at any point in that space we can associate a value.
And that makes sense.
If you were to take a thermometer and measure any
"point in space in the room that you're in right now,"
you would get a temperature.
"You wouldn't get a temperature and a direction, so it's"
not a vector field.
You would just get a temperature.
And that's why it's called a scalar field.
Associated with every coordinate is just
So how would we view the gradient of this function?
Well the gradient of this function is going to tell us in
"which direction-- and actually, the gradient of this function"
"is going to generate a vector field, because it's going to"
tell us in which direction do we have the largest
increase in temperature.
"And also, the magnitude of those vectors in that vector"
field will tell us how large of an increase in temperature
we are looking at.
Or you can kind of view it as almost a
three-dimensional slope.
Hope that doesn't confuse you.
"So let's compute the gradient, and then I'll show you a"
diagram that might make things a little bit more intuitive.
Let me erase this thing down here.
"And I'm going to switch from this blue color, because"
it's a little nauseating.
So the gradient of T is going to be equal to the partial
derivative T with respect to x times the unit vector in the x
"direction, plus the partial derivative of the temperature"
function with respect to y times the unit vector in the y
"direction, plus the partial derivative of the temperature"
function with respect to z times the unit vector
in the z direction.
And now we just plug and chug and figure out the
partial derivatives.
So the gradient of T is equal to-- now you might be daunted.
"Oh, I have an e to this three variable function, how do I"
take the partial derivative?
"Remember, if you're taking the partial derivative with respect"
to x you just pretend like the y's and the z's are constants.
So let's do that.
So let's take the derivative of the inside function.
That's the way I view it.
"So minus x squared plus y squared plus z squared,"
with respect to x.
So you could distribute this minus if you like.
So it'd be minus x squared minus y squared
minus z squared.
So the derivative of that with respect to x is just going to
"be-- these are just constants, so the derivative with"
respect to x is just 0.
So the derivative is minus 2x.
Right?
Minus 2x is the derivative of minus x squared.
Minus 2x times the derivative of the outside.
"Well, what's the derivative of e to the x?"
The derivative of e to the x is e to the x.
That's why e is such an amazing number.
the derivative of a constant times something the
constant carries over.
"So the derivative of the outside expression, the way I"
"imagine it, is equal to 10 e to the minus x squared plus"
y squared plus z squared.
And then all of that times the unit vector in the i direction.
Right?
And now we can do the same thing for the y direction.
So plus-- what's the partial derivative of
this with respect to y?
Well it's going to look very similar.
The partial derivative of this inner function with respect
"to y, it's minus y squared."
So it's minus 2y.
just itself again.
So times 10 e to the minus x squared plus y
squared plus z squared.
And then all of that times the unit vector in the
y direction times j.
"And then finally, the partial derivative of the temperature"
function with respect to z.
And that's just minus 2z times 10 e to the minus x squared
plus y squared plus z squared.
This is just the chain rule.
And I'm treating the other two variables that I'm not taking
"the partial derivative with respect to, as constants."
And then all of that times the unit vector in the k direction.
And we could simplify this a little bit.
You could have minus 2x times 10.
That's minus 20x.
Let me write it up here.
So the gradient of the temperature function is equal
to minus 20 e to the minus x squared plus y squared-- you
"probably can't read this-- plus z squared, times i minus 20y."
"And actually, I'm not going to go into that, because I realize"
I'm running out of time.
I think you can simplify this algebraically.
"But anyway, the more important thing is I always find with"
"gradients it's easy to calculate them, but the"
intuition-- oh sorry.
This is also included.
This is a k right here.
The harder part is the intuition.
So let's get an intuition of what this gradient function
will actually look like.
So what would happen.
"If you wanted to know the gradient at any point in space,"
"you would substitute an x, y, and z in here."
So you could write it as the gradient function is a
"function of x, y, and z."
"Remember, T, the temperature at any point, was a scalar field."
At any point in three dimensions it just
gave you a number.
"Now when you have the gradient, at any point in three"
dimensions it gives you a vector.
Right?
"Because it has i, j, and k components."
"Where the magnitude are the partial derivatives, and"
"then the direction is given by i, j, and k."
So we've gone from having a scalar field to a vector field.
And let's see what it looks like.
So this is the vector field.
This is actually the gradient of the function that
we just solved for.
"And as you can see, at any point-- and when this graphing"
"program that did it, it just picked different points and it"
"calculated the gradients at that point, and then it"
graphed them as vectors.
So the length of the vectors are just the magnitudes of
"the x, y, and z components."
And then you add them together like you would add any vectors.
And then the direction is given by the relative weighting of
"the i, j, and k components."
"And as you can see, the intuition is pretty"
interesting.
"As you get closer and closer to our heat source, the rate at"
"which the temperature increases, increases!"
Right?
"The vectors as you get closer, get bigger and bigger."
And let me zoom in.
So we're now within the vector field.
And you can see as we get closer and closer to the center
"of our heat source, the vectors, the rate at which the"
"temperature increases, gets bigger and bigger and bigger."
"Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you."
"When I first learned gradients, I think the computation is"
relatively straightforward.
It's just partial derivatives.
But the intuition is always the interesting thing.
And hopefully this temperature analogy-- and not even
analogy-- this temperature model will make a
little sense to you.
But it applies to pretty much any scalar field.
"Anyway, I'll see you in the next video."

"As we begin our journey into the world of economics, "
"I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all time, "
the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith.

"the American Declaration of Independence, and it's one of his most-famous excerpts. "
"He generally indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest, "
nor knows how much he is promoting it. 
"By directing that industry, so that the industry in control of that individual actor "
"in such a manner, as its produce may be of the greatest value, "
he intends only his own gain. 
'He intends only his own gain'. 
"And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand "
to promote an end which was no part of his intention. 
"And this term ""the invisible hand"" is famous. "
Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. 
"He is saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest, "
that often in aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend. 
Then he says: nor is it always the worst for society 
that it was no part of it. 
"So, it was not necessarily a bad thing. "
"By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes "
that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. 
"So, this is really a pretty strong statement. "
It's really at the core of capitalism. 
And that's why I point out that it was published 
"in the same year as the American Declaration of Independence, "
"because obviously America, the Funding Fathers, "
"they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, "
"that really talks about what it means to be a democratic country, "
what are the rights of its citizens. 
"But the United States, with its overall experience of an American, "
"is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith, "
by this kind of foundational ideas of capitalism. 
And they just both happened to happen around the same time. 
"But this idea is not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing "
their own self-interested ends might be doing more for society than 
than if any of them actually tried to promote the overall well-being of society. 
And I don't think that Adam Smith would say that it's always good 
"for someone to act self-interested, or that it's never good for people to actually "
"think about the implications of what they are doing in an aggregate sense, "
"but he is saying that frequently .. frequently, this self-interested action "
<i>could</i> lead to the greater good. Could lead to more innovation. 
"Could lead to better investment. Could lead to more productivity. COuld lead to more wealth, "
"more, a larger pie for everyone. "
"And now Economics is frequently .. and when he makes a statement, he is actually making "
a mix of micro-economic and macro-economic statements. 
"Micro is that people, individual actors are acting out of their own self-interest. "
"And the macro is that it might be good for the economy, or the nation as a whole. "
"And so, now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools, "
"or into these two subjects: microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors. "
"Microeconomics .. and those actors could be firms, could be people, it could be households. "
"And you have macro-economics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate. "
Macro-economics. And you get it from the words. 
"Micro -- the prefix refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger, "
to the bigger picture. 
"And so, micro-economics is essentially how actors .. actors make decisions "
"or, you could actually say 'allocations', allocations .. decisions or allocations. "
Allocation .. 
of scarce resources. And you hear the words scarce resources a lot 
when people talk about economics. 
And a scarce resource is one you don't have an infinite amount of. 
"For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love. "
"But a resource that would be scarce is something like food, or water, or money, or time, or labor. "
These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is how do people decide 
"where to put those scarce resource, how do they decide where to deploy them. "
"And how does that .. does that affect prices and markets, and whatever else. "
Macro-economics is the study of what happens at the aggregate to an economy. 
"So, 'aggregate', what happens in aggregate to an economy, from the millions of individual actors. "
Aggregate economy. We now have millions of actors. 
And often focuses on policy-related questions. 
"SO, do you raise or lower taxes. Or, what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes. "
Do you regulate or de-regulate? How does that affect the overall productivity 
"when you do this. So, it's policy, top-down .. 'top-down' questions. "
"And in both macro- and micro-economics, there is especially in the modern sense of it, "
"there is an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical. "
"So, in either case you could start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas, "
"so of the logical ideas, to say someone like Adam Smith might have. "
"So, you have these basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions. "
"So, philosophy, 'philosophy' of people, of decision-making, "
in the case of micro-economics -- 'decision-making' 
And then you make some assumptions about it. 
Or you simplify it .. let me write this .. you simplify it. 
"And you really are simplifying. You say ""oh, all people are rational"", "
"""all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain"", "
which isn't true -- human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things. 
"We simplify things, so we can start to deal with it kind of a mathematical way. "
"SO you simplify it, so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense. "
"So, this is valuable to clarify your thinking. "
It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions. 
"And so, you can start to visualize things mathematically, with charts and graphs "
and think about what would actually happen with markets. 
"So it's very valuable to have this mathematical, rigorous, thinking. "
"But at the same time, it could be a little bit dangerous, because you are making "
"these huge simplifications, and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions. "
"Conclusions, which you might feel very strongly about, because it looks like you've proven them "
"in the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based "
"on some assumptions that either might be wrong, or might be over-simplifications, "
or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about. 
"So it's very very very important to take it all with a grain of salt, "
to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumption. 
And macro-economics is probably more guilty of it. 
In micro-economics you are taking these deeply complicated things that are 
"the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then "
"you are aggregating it over millions of people, so it's ultra-complicated. "
"You've millions of these infinitely complicated people, all interacting with each other. "
"SO, it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions, and "
"fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those, "
trying to make assumptions and then doing math with that -- 
that could lead you to some conclusions or might be leading you to some predictions. 
"And, once again, this is very important. This is valuable, it is valuable to make these mathematical models, "
"with these mathematical assumptions for these mathematical conclusions, "
but it always need to be taken with a grain of salt. 
"So, then you have a proper grain of salt, so that you are always focused on the true intuition. "
And that's really the most important thing to get from a course on economics. 
"So you can truly reason through what's likely to happen, "
maybe even without the mathematics. 
"I'll leave you with two quotes. And thse quotes are a little bit .. a little bit funny, "
"but they're really I think helpful things to keep in mind, "
especially when you go deep into the mathematical side of economics. 
"So, this right over here is a quote by Aflred Knopf, who was publisher in the 1900s. "
"""An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible."" "
"And I'm assuming what he is talking about as the incomprehensible, he is referring to some of the 'mathy' stuff "
"that you see in economics, and hopefully we're going to make this "
as comprehensible as possible. 
You'll see there is value in this. 
But it's a very important statement he is making. 
"Oftentimes, it's taking a common-sense thing. "
It's taking something that's obvious .. that's obvious. 
"And it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that "
"you have the intuition for what's happening in the math, "
or to know when the math is going into a direction that might be strange 
based on over-simplifications or wrong assumptions. 
"And then you have this quote here by Lawrence J. Peter, "
"most famous for Peter's Principals, a professor at USC. "
"""An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things "
"he predicted yesterday didn't happen today."" "
"And once again -- important to keep in the back of one's mind, "
"because especially relevant to macro-economics, because in macro-economics "
there is always all sorts of prediction about the state of the economy: 
"about what need to be done, about how long the recession will last, what will be the economic growth next year, "
what will inflation do ... and they often prove to be wrong. 
"In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things. "
"And it's very important to realize that, because oftentimes when you are deep "
"in the mathematics, economics might <i>seem</i> to be a science, like physics, "
"but it's not a science like physics. It is open .. it is open to subjectivity, "
and a lot of that subjectivity is all around the assumptions that you choose to make.

So welcome to the Lean Launchpad class. 
"If you're interested in the logistics on how to take this class, "
"this lecture zero will describe it. But if you want to just get started, "
click on lecture one. So the good news is there's actually 
four ways to watch these lectures: 
So a good way is to kind of watch them and use the Udacity 
discussion forums to interact with other people watching these lectures. 
"Something that's better is, these lectures are free and "
they don't really require any books or text. 
"But there are books or texts, and I would feel a little guilty "
"not telling you that Alexander Osterwalder's ""Business Model Generation"" "
"book is kind of the standard for understanding the business model canvas, "
"and The Startup Owner's Manual, written by yours truly "
"and my co-author, Bob Dorf, is kind of the standard for customer development. "
"But let me emphasize again, these are not required, "
and you could understand the lectures just fine without them. 
But they certainly help explain a lot of the detail in the 
"617 pages, because it's almost an encyclopedia for startups. "
Enough of the ad--that's the last time I'll mention buying 
the texts or books. Almost best is to actually watch these 
"lectures, but this time form a startup team and actually "
think about--instead of just sitting in your office or on your 
computer--actually be watching these as you start your company. 
"Now, the best way to actually watch these lectures "
is with facilitators and coaches and mentors. 
and the way you can do that is by physically taking the 
"class with Startup Weekend Next. If you go to the website, "
"swnext.org, you could find out how to sign up in your city "
"and town, and participate as a team, with groups of other teams "
"physically, week to week. "
"and one of the reasons we kind of suggest that you, "
"instead of just watching the lectures, actually get out of "
"the building and do it--either by yourself or with your team, "
or with Startup Weekend--is startups are not about lectures. 
"And entrepreneurship is not about your grades, "
and this class is about the work you do outside the building 
"after you watch the lectures, not how much of the lectures you watch. "
"Entrepreneurship is experiential, it's hands-on, "
and it's immediate and intense feedback.

One often heard contemporary economic myth is that the rich are getting richer and the 
"poor are getting poorer. Like any myth there is a nugget of truth to this. For example, "
"if we look at the data, the top 20 percent of income earners today do have a larger share "
"of national income than they did in the past, and the bottom 20 percent of income earners "
do have a smaller share of national income than they had in the past. 
"There’s two problems with that data. First of all, that data doesn’t tell us anything "
about the absolute condition of the poor: Just because one has a smaller share of income 
"doesn’t mean that one is absolutely poor. So, for example, it could be the case that "
"even though poor Americans have a smaller share of national income, their absolute income "
"is higher. If I asked you, would you rather have a sixth of a pizza or a ninth of a pizza, "
your answer might depend on how big the pizza is. And having one-ninth of a pizza might 
be better if the pizza was much larger than the one of which you’d have one-sixth. 
The real income of poor Americans today is higher than it used to be even though their 
share of total income is somewhat lower. But all this misses the more fundamental point. 
The bigger problem is that data is snapshot data that compares wealthy people in one year 
"with wealthy people in years before, poor people in one year with poor people in years "
before. 
What it doesn’t take into account is the movement in individual households through 
"time. If we could track individual households, we might be able to know what happens to poor "
"people in, say, five years or ten years or fifteen years. And in fact, we do have that "
"data. One set of data shows that between 1979 and 1988, 86 percent of households that were "
"poor in 1979, were no longer poor in 1988. A second set of data from the University of "
"Michigan shows that of households that were poor in 1975, over 95 percent of them were "
no longer poor by 1991. 
One of the most important things to understand when we talk about the rich getting richer 
"and the poor getting poorer is this idea of income mobility. The reality is, for most "
"Americans, that they start off poor and they slowly become richer over time. And in fact, "
"if we look at that data comparing 1975 and 1991, what we find is that the average income "
"gain for rich households over that period was just about $4,000, but the average gain "
"for poor households over that period: $28,000. "
"So what really happened between 1975 and 1991 is that the rich got richer, but the poor "
"got richer a lot faster than the rich did. So whenever we talk about rich and poor, we "
have to take account of this issue of income mobility. So how can it be that most Americans 
are getting richer when we know that there are still plenty of poor people out there? 
Well the fact is that one of the things that happens over time is who comprises the income 
"distribution changes. Immigrants, young people entering the labor force come into that income "
distribution at low levels of income. They become the new poor while the old poor slowly 
move their way up. 
So even though a first glance at the data may make it seem like the rich are getting 
"richer and the poor are getting poorer, the reality of the United States in the early "
"21st century is that everybody’s getting richer, rich and poor alike. And the idea "
that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is largely a statistical 
artifact and mostly a myth.

We now have the general tools 
to really tackle any multiplication problems. 
So in this video I'm just going to do a ton of examples. 
So let's start off with-- and I'll start in yellow. 
Let's start off with thirty-two times eighteen. 
Say eight times two is sixteen. 
"Well, I'll do it in our head this time "
because you don't always have all this space to work with. 
So eight times two is sixteen. 
Put the one up there. 
Eight times three is twenty-four. 
Twenty-four plus one is twenty-five. 
So eight times thirty-two was two hundred fifty-six. 
"Now we're going to have to multiply this one, "
"which is really a ten, times thirty-two. "
I'll underline it with the orange. 
"One times two-- oh, we have to be very careful here. "
One times two is two. 
"So you might say hey, let me stick a two down there. "
"Remember, this isn't a one. "
"This is a ten, so we have to stick a zero there "
to remember that. 
So ten times two is twenty. 
"Or you say one times two is two, "
"but you're putting it in the tens place, so you still get twenty. "
So ten times two is twenty. 
It works out. 
Then one times three. 
And we have to be very careful. 
Let's get rid of what we had from before. 
One times three is three. 
"There's nothing to add here, so you just get a three. "
And so you get ten times thirty-two is three hundred twenty. 
"This one right here, that's a ten. "
Ten plus eight is eighteen. 
So now we just add up the two numbers. 
You add them up. 
Six plus zero is six. 
Five plus two is seven. 
Two plus three is five. 
Let's keep going. 
Let's do ninety-nine times eighty-eight. 
That's going to give us a big number! 
Eight times nine is seventy-two. 
Stick the seven up there. 
And then you have eight times nine again. 
"Eight times nine is seventy-two, but now you have the seven up here. "
So seventy-two plus seven is seventy-nine. 
Fair enough. 
Now we're done with this. 
Let's just delete it 
just so that we don't get confused in our next step. 
"In our next step, we're going to multiply this eight now times ninety-nine. "
But this eight is an eighty. 
So let's stick a zero down there. 
Eight times nine is seventy-two. 
Stick a seven up there. 
Then eight times nine is seventy-two. 
Plus seven is seventy-nine. 
Two plus zero is two. 
Let me switch colors. 
Nine plus two is eleven. 
Carry the one. 
One plus seven is eight. 
Eight plus nine is seventeen. 
Carry the one. 
One plus seven is eight. 
Eight thousand seven hundred twelve. 
Let's keep going. 
Can't do enough of these. 
"All right, fifty-three times seventy-eight. "
I think you're getting the hang of it now. 
Let's multiply eight times fifty-three first. 
So eight times three is twenty-four. 
Stick the two up there. 
Eight times five is forty. 
Forty plus two is forty-two. 
Now we're going to have to deal with that seven. 
"That seven right there, which is really a seventy. "
So we got to remember to put the zero there. 
"Seven times three, and let's get rid of this. "
Don't want to get confused. 
Seven times three is twenty-one. 
Put the one there and put the two up here. 
Seven times five is thirty-five. 
Plus two is thirty-seven. 
Now we're ready to add. 
Four plus zero is four. 
Two plus one is three. 
Four plus seven is eleven. 
Carry the one. 
One plus three is four. 
Four thousand one hundred thirty-four. 
Let's up the stakes a little bit. 
So let's say I had seven hundred ninety-six times fifty-eight. 
Let's mix it up well. 
"All right, so first we're just going to multiply eight times seven hundred ninety-six. "
"And notice, I've thrown in an extra digit up here. "
So eight times six is forty-eight. 
Put the four up there. 
Eight times nine is seventy-two. 
Plus four is seventy-six. 
And then eight times seven is fifty-six. 
Fifty-six plus seven is sixty-three. 
I'm sure I'll make a careless mistake 
at some point in this video. 
And the goal for you is to identify if and when I do. 
"All right, now we're ready, "
so we can get rid of these guys up here. 
"Now we can multiply this five, which is in the tens place. "
It's really a fifty. 
Times this up here. 
Because it's a fifty we stick a zero down there. 
Five times six is thirty. 
"Put the zero there, put the three up there. "
Five times nine is forty-five. 
Plus the three is forty-eight. 
Five times seven is thirty-five. 
Plus four is thirty-nine. 
Now we're ready to add. 
Eight plus zero is eight. 
Six plus zero is six. 
Three plus eight is eleven. 
One plus six is seven. 
Seven plus nine is sixteen. 
And then one plus three is four. 
So seven hundred ninety-six times fifty-eight is forty-six thousand one hundred sixty-eight. 
"And that sounds about right, "
because seven hundred ninety-six-- it's almost eight hundred. 
"You know, which is almost one thousand. "
So if we multiplied one thousand times fifty-eight we'd get fifty-eight thousand. 
But we're multiplying something a little bit smaller 
"than one thousand times fifty-eight, "
so we're getting something a little bit smaller than fifty-eight thousand. 
So the number is in the correct ballpark. 
Now let's do one more here 
where I'm really going to step up the stakes. 
Let's do five hundred twenty-three times-- 
I'm going to do a three-digit number now. 
Times seven hundred ninety-eight. 
That's a big three-digit number! 
But it's the same exact process. 
And once you kind of see the pattern 
"you'll say, hey, this'll apply to any number of digits times any number of digits. "
It'll just start taking you a long time 
"and your chances of making a careless mistake are going to go up, "
but it's the same idea. 
So we start with eight times five hundred twenty-three. 
Eight times three is twenty-four. 
Stick the two up there. 
Now eight times two is sixteen. 
Sixteen plus two is eighteen. 
Put the one up there. 
Eight times five is forty. 
Plus one is forty-one. 
So eight times five hundred twenty-three is four thousand one hundred eighty-four. 
We're not done. 
We have to multiply times the ninety and by the seven hundred. 
So let's do the ninety right there. 
"So it's a ninety, so we'll stick a zero there. "
It's not a nine. 
And let's get rid of these guys right there. 
Nine times three is twenty-seven. 
Nine times two is eighteen. 
Eighteen plus two is twenty. 
And then we have nine times five is forty-five. 
Forty-five plus two is forty-seven. 
I don't want to write it that thick. 
Forty-seven. 
"Let me make sure I did that one right, "
and let's just review it a little bit. 
Nine times three was twenty-seven. 
We wrote the seven down here and put the two up there. 
Nine times two is eighteen. 
"We added two to that, so we wrote twenty. "
Wrote the zero down there and the two up there. 
The nine times five was forty-five. 
Plus two is forty-seven. 
You really have to make sure 
that you don't make careless mistakes with these. 
"Then finally, we have to multiply the seven, "
which is really a seven hundred times five hundred twenty-three. 
When it was just an eight we just started multiplying here. 
"When it was a ninety, when we were dealing with the tens place, "
we put a zero there. 
Now that we're dealing with something that's in the hundreds 
we're going to put two zeros there. 
And so you have seven-- and let's get rid of this stuff. 
Seven times three is twenty-one. 
Put the one there. 
Stick the two up there. 
Seven times two is fourteen. 
Fourteen plus our two is sixteen. 
Put the one up there. 
Seven times five is thirty-five. 
Plus one is thirty-six. 
And now we're ready to add. 
And hopefully we didn't make any careless mistakes. 
So four plus zero plus zero. 
That's easy. 
That's four. 
Eight plus seven plus zero. 
That's fifteen. 
Carry the one. 
One plus one plus one is three. 
Four plus seven plus six. 
That's what's? 
Four plus six is ten. 
It's seventeen. 
And then we have one plus four is five. 
Five plus six is eleven. 
Carry the one. 
One plus three is four. 
So five hundred twenty-three times seven hundred ninety-eight 
is four hundred seventeen thousand three hundred fifty-four. 
Now we can even check to make sure. 
And so this is the moment of truth. 
"Let's see if we have-- let's see, "
five hundred twenty-three times seven hundred ninety-eight. 
There you go. 
Moment of truth. 
I don't have to re-record this video. 
It's four hundred seventeen thousand three hundred fifty-four. 
"But we did it without the calculator, "
which is the important point. 
""
How you doing? Justin here. 
"Hopefully, you've done a little bit of practice "
and you've got your D chord sounding really cool. 
"So, because I don't know any songs at all "
"that have just got one chord all the way through, "
I guess we need to learn another one. 
And this next one we're going to check out is the chord A. 
Now there's quite a few different ways of fingering this chord. 
"And the one that I'm going to show you, "
"the one that I think is the best now, "
isn't the one I learned. 
So sometimes you'll see me playing A chord another way. 
"But the way that I'm going to show you works really, really really good "
"for swapping between your D chord and your A chord, "
"which is one of the biggest problems you have when you're a beginner, "
is changing between the chords. 
"It's not actually playing the chords, "
but we haven't gotten to that yet. 
"You've still got to discover that horrible bit of learning the guitar, "
"that ""Oh my god I can't move my fingers fast enough""-stage. "
But we'll get there very soon. 
"So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you "
"my recommended way of playing an A chord, "
and then I'm going to show you a couple of alternatives 
that maybe you've learned before or whatever. 
"And if you really want to do one of those other ones, then do it, "
but I will hopefully give you enough good reasons 
to play the A chord with my suggested fingering. 
"So, let's go to a close-up and check out the A chord. "
So here we are for a little close look up at our A chord. 
Here we go. So the first thing we're going to do is go 
through the fingers and get the fingers in the right places. 
Now first thing you'll notice is: 
first finger is actually in the same place as it was for our D chord. 
"But, we're going to have to pull it back a little bit. "
"So it would be nice to have it right up close to the fret, "
but unfortunately we can't. 
So start with this one in the middle of the fret. 
I'm going to explain why in a second. 
"So that's our first finger. Pretty easy : second fret, third string. "
Then second finger is going to reach over the top 
"you see, this is why we had to leave the space there, "
so we've got space here for the second finger 
"to go on the fourth string, second fret. "
"And then third finger is sneaking also into the second fret, "
but on the second string. 
So you can see they're all kind of getting a bit squashed up here. 
"Now, you'll notice here that the second finger and the third finger "
"are both really close to the second fret which is great, "
and only the first finger has to be back a bit. 
And this is the fingering for an A chord that I really recommend. 
"Now, the traditional approach, "
"which is the one that I did, is like this. "
"With the fingers one, two and three all in a row. "
Then you can see that we can't get our second finger much further forward anyway 
"because third finger is in the way, "
and it means that first finger is miles back from the fret 
and we'd have to press that really hard in order to get that note to come out clearly. 
Very likely it's going to sound like this 
. . . 
"you're not going to get that note sounding very clear, "
whereas if now you just see we swap first and second fingers over 
. . . 
straight away we can get those two fingers up close 
and first finger you can kind of sneak it up. 
"Sneak it up the back there, with the first finger "
to try and get it as close to the fret as we possibly can 
"So that's the old approach, I think this is a much better approach "
"Some people even prefer to do it like this, "
"with fingers two, three and four, "
particularly if they've got really big fingers. 
Some people find that a little bit easier. 
Now I'm not a big fan of this method. 
"it's possible, cause so long as you're pressing down the dots, you're OK. "
"But I really, really recommend that you do these fingers: "
"one on the third string, "
then reaching over with the second finger 
and then the third finger. 
"So, now what we're going to do is "
remember that we check out each note one at a time. 
"We do the strum, pick out and strum "
"and make any corrections that we need to, "
to make sure that every note sounds good. 
This is really important. 
"Also, by looking at the neck diagram there, "
you can also notice that we shouldn't play now 
the thickest string 
because that's got a little X at the top. 
So we're not going to play the thickest string. 
So we're just going to start our strum 
from the fifth string. Strum down 
. . . 
"and now as we go to a close-up, "
we're going to check out the possible things 
"that might make the notes sound funny as we do one note at a time. So, "
. . . 
"There's your open A string. If there's a mistake there, "
"it means that your second finger is up too far, "
so bring it down. It should be an easy note to get. 
"Next note is the note with our second finger on, "
which is on the fourth string. 
Want to make sure that that's nice and clear. 
There's not really too many things 
that can make that note go wrong 
so that one should be easy. Next note : 
. . . 
Now what you may find is cause your first finger is back quite far 
. . . 
that you get this kind of sound. 
"Now that's only because the finger is so far away from the fret, "
the only way that you're going to fix it 
is to try and bring it closer to the fret if you can 
and also to press harder. 
Even if you're right back 
. . . 
"if you press really hard, you will get that note clear. "
"So try and sneak it up as best you can, "
and then press a bit harder with that first finger 
if that note's a bit causing you problems. 
Third finger shouldn't be giving you any grief. 
"Just make sure it's nicely seated, "
make sure it's not on the fret. 
Cause as soon as you get on the fret 
. . . 
gets a bit dead. Behind the fret : 
. . . 
nice and clear. If it's on the fret : 
. . . 
kind of goes a bit dead. So make sure it's behind the fret 
. . . 
Now last one 
. . . 
is the E string. 
A lot of people have problems with the E string 
because the third finger here touches the E string. 
It's all fingers touching the wrong strings 
the cause of most of our problems. 
So we want to make sure 
"that the third finger is nice and round, "
you can see that all of the fingers are kind of arched around. 
"Don't let your fingers do this, "
like they're too flat. 
That's always going to lead to problems. 
Nice and round. 
. . . 
And that should lead you to have a nice A chord.

"We need to calculate 9.005 minus 3.6, or we could view it "
as 9 and 5 thousandths minus 3 and 6 tenths. 
"Whenever you do a subtracting decimals problem, the most "
"important thing, and this is true when you're adding decimals as well, "
is you have to line up the decimals. 
So this is 9.005 minus 3.6. 
"So we've lined up the decimals, and now we're ready "
to subtract. 
Now we can subtract. 
So we start up here. 
We have 5 minus nothing. 
"You can imagine this 3.6, or this 3 and 6 tenths, we could "
"add two zeroes right here, and it would be the same thing as "
"3 and 600 thousandths, which is the same thing as 6 tenths. "
"And when you look at it that way, you'd say, OK, 5 minus 0 "
"is nothing, and you just write a 5 right there. "
"Or you could have said, if there's nothing there, it "
would have been 5 minus nothing is 5. 
"Then you have 0 minus 0, which is just 0. "
And then you have a 0 minus 6. 
And you can't subtract 6 from 0. 
"So we need to get something into this space right here, "
and what we essentially are going to do is regroup. 
"We're going to take one 1 from the 9, so let's do that. "
"So let's take one 1 from the 9, so it becomes an 8. "
And we need to do something with that one 1. 
We're going to put it in the tenths place. 
"Now remember, one whole is equal to 10 tenths. "
This is the tenths place. 
So then this will become 10. 
"Sometimes it's taught that you're borrowing the 1, but "
"you're really taking it, and you're actually taking 10 from "
the place to your left. 
"So one whole is 10 tenths, we're in the tenths place. "
So you have 10 minus 6. 
Let me switch colors. 
10 minus 6 is 4. 
"You have your decimal right there, and then you have 8 "
minus 3 is 5. 
So 9.005 minus 3.6 is 5.405.

ESBG stands for European Straw Bale Gathering. 
"It is a bi-yearly event, which brings together craftsmen "
"builders, "
"architects, "
engineers 
and all others who are passionate about building with bales. 
"So, If you are seriously interested in building with straw "
that is an event you can not miss! 
My name is Paweł and I’d like to invite you 
to co-create this unique event held this year in Poland. 
"It’is going to take place in Łódź, "
in the last 5 days of August 2013. 
"Because of it's location it is going to be the very first, "
post-industrial ESBG! 
"But not only that, "
"it is also going to be the first crowd-funded one, "
which means full independence 
by giving this idea to the people. 
"By sharing our resources like money, "
"time, knowledge "
we can co-create experience 
and a change we what to see in the world 
The programme of this event 
is a mixture of theory and practice 
with a lot of opportunities for networking. 
Planned activities include: 
"conference, discussion panels, "
"workshops, exhibition and a bus trip "
"to a nearby natural buildings, f.e. this one. "
This year main theme “Simplicity is a feature” 
means that we will focus on finding simple and elegant 
solutions to amitious questions 
"of sustainable and affordable construction, "
design and education in Straw-Bale Building. 
We want to raise a number of topics 
from technical details through research 
to international cooperation and education. 
So if you want be responsible 
for making this wonderful idea happen 
please support it. 
By sharing your resources 
you’ll give a sign that this event is needed

Where did quantum theory come from? 
"It started, not as a crazy idea, but witha light bulb. In the early 1890s, the German "
Bureau of Standards asked Max Planck how tomake light bulbs more efficient so that they 
would give out the maximum light for the leastelectrical power. 
The first task Planck faced was to predicthow much light a hot filament gives off. He 
"knew that light consists of electromagneticwaves, with different colors of light carried "
by different frequency waves. The problemwas to ensure that as much light as possible 
was given off by visible waves rather thanultraviolet or infrared. 
"He tried to work out how much light of eachcolor a hot object emits, but his predictions "
based on electromagnetic theory kept disagreeingwith experiments. 
"Instead, in what he later called an “actof despair,” he threw the existing theory "
out the window and worked backwards from experimentalmeasurements. The data pointed him to a new 
"rule of physics: light waves carry energyonly in packets, with high frequency light "
consisting of large packets of energy andlow frequency light consisting of small packets 
of energy. 
"The idea that light comes in packets, or ""quanta"",may sound crazy, and it was at the time, but "
Einstein soon related it to a much more familiarproblem: sharing. 
"If you want to make a kid happy... give thema cookie! But if there are two kids, and you "
"only have one cookie, you'll only be ableto cheer them up half as much. And if there "
"are four, or eight, or sixteen hundred thousand,you're not going to make them very happy at "
all if they have to share one cookie betweenthem. 
"In fact, if you have a room with infinitelymany kids but not infinitely many cookies, "
"if you share the cookies evenly each kid willonly get an infinitesimally small crumb, and "
none of them will be cheered up. And they'llstill eat all your cookies. 
The difference between light waves and kidsis that you can't actually have infinitely 
"many kids in a room. But because light wavescome in all sizes, you can have arbitrarily "
"small light waves, so you can fit infinitelymany into a room. And then the light waves "
"would consume all your cookies… I mean,energy. "
"In fact, all these infinitesimal waves togetherwould have an infinite capacity to absorb "
"energy, and they'd suck all the heat out ofanything you put into the room… instantly "
"freezing the tea in your cup, or the sun,or even a supernova. "
"Luckily, the universe doesn't work that way…because, as Planck guessed, the tiny, high "
frequency waves can only carry away energyin huge packets. They're like fussy kids who'll 
"only accept exactly thirty-seven cookies,or a hundred and sixty-two thousand cookies, "
"no more and no less. Because they're so picky,the fussy high frequency waves lose out and "
most of the energy is carried away in lower-frequencypackets that are willing to take an equal 
"share. This common, average energy that thepackets carry, is in fact what we mean by "
"""temperature."" "
"So a higher temperature just means higheraverage energy, and thus by Planck's rule, "
a higher frequency of light emitted. That'swhy as an object gets hotter it glows first 
"infrared, then red, yellow, white; hotterand hotter towards blue, violet, ultraviolet… "
and so on. 
"Specifically, Planck's quantum theory of fussylight tells us that light bulb filaments should "
be heated to a temperature of about 3200 Kelvinto ensure that most of the energy is emitted 
"as visible waves - much hotter, and we'd starttanning from the ultraviolet light. "
"Actually, quantum physics has been staringus in the face since long before lightbulbs "
"and tanning beds: human beings have been makingfires for millennia, with the color of the "
"flames spelling out ""quantum"" all along. "

"When you buy a US treasury security, you are essentially giving a loan "
to the US Federal Government 
This is an example here 
I have a US treasure security here 
it says that the owner of this piece of paper here will be paid $1000 in one year 
"so, if you buy this from the Treasury, maybe from somewhere else "
let's just say that the government is issuing them right now 
"let's say you buy it for, you buy it for $950 and the government will "
will give you this security right over here 
now fast forward 1 year you're holding this security 
and what'll happen? 
so you know that stuff is written there 
what'll happen a year later? 
Well it's written on the security and I simplified it just for the example 
it says the holder of this security will get $1000 
"so at this point, the US government has to give you $1000 "
"so you look at just the money flow, it's pretty clear that you're just lending the money "
"you give them $950 now, and then a year later, they'll give you $1000 "
and if you want to put this in terms that you normally associate with borrowing money 
in terms of how much interest that you'll get 
"well, you lent $950 and you got back $1000 "
"So, let's think about it this way "
Let's get the calculator out 
"So, 1000 divided by 950 is equal to 1.053, or 105.3% of your money back "
This is 105.3% of money lent 
of money given to the government 
or another to think about it is 
you got a 5.3% interest or you lent your money out at an annual interest of 5.3% 
"you got your money back, plus you got 5.3% after one year "
"So, you could imagine, of all sudden many people want to buy this government security. "
"Now the price goes up, instead of 950 dollars, imagine it is now 980 dollars. What is the implicit yield that "
the person get on it 
we'll get the calculator back on here 
"so, you paid in 980, instead of 950. Then a year later "
"when you get the 1000 dollars back, there'll be 102% of your money "
"So, in that situation there will be 102% of your money "
"so, at the 950 dollar price, you're essentially lending the government money at 5.3% "
"And 980 dollars, you are lending the government money at 2%. "
And I'm doing this just to show you a point 
"When the price of the treasury security goes up, as happened in this case "
"the yield, or the interest, that you are getting on your loan goes down "
"in either situation, you're going to get your 1000 dollars back. "
"if you're lending 950 and get 1000 dollars back, you'll get 5.3 % "
So this is what people are talking about when they say 
"treasury prices go up, if treasury prices go up "
then the yields go down 
"So, there's more demand for the treasury, the interest on the treasury will go down "
In the next video we'll talk about how this might change for treasuries of different maturity dates

Human beings have always observed that is you have 
"an object that is moving, "
"so this is a moving object, "
"traveling to the right here, "
that it seems to stop on it's own. 
"That if you do nothing to this moving object, "
"on it's own, this object is going to come to a stop. "
It is going to come to rest. 
"And on the other side of things, "
"if you want to keep an object moving, "
you have to keep applying a force to it. 
We've never in our everyday experience 
seen an object that just keeps moving 
on and on forever without anyone acting on it. 
It seems like something will always stop. 
"And this is why, for most of human history, "
"probably pre-history, but we definitely know the ancient Greeks "
"all the way until the early 1600s, "
"so for at least 2000 years, "
"the assumption was ""objects have a natural tendency to stop."" "
Objects ... have ... tendency ... to come to rest or to stop. 
"And if you want to keep them moving, "
you have to apply some type of a net force to it. 
"And once again, this is completly consistent with "
"everyday human experience, "
this is what we've all experienced our entire lives. 
"But then these gentlemen show up in the 1600s, "
"and you might be surprised to see three gentlemen here, "
because this is about Newton's first law of motion. 
"And, indead, one of these gentlemen is "
Sir Isaac Newton. 
That's Newton right over there [middle]. 
But these other too guys get at least as much credit for it 
because they actually described really what 
"Newton's first Law describes, "
and they did it before Newton. 
This is Galileo. 
And this is Rene Descarts. 
"And they describe it in different ways, "
and Newton frankly get's the credit for it 
because he really encapsulates into a broader framework 
"with his other Laws, and the Laws of Gravitation, "
"which was really the basics of classical mechanics, "
"and seem to describe, at least until the 20th Century, "
most of how reality actually worked. 
"And their big insight, and it was very unintuitive at the time, "
{so now we come to the 1600s} 
"Is that these three gentlemen said, "
maybe it works the other way. 
"Maybe objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity, their speed and their direction. "
"And if their speed is zero, they'll maintain that restfulness. "
Unless they're acted upon by an unbalanced force. 
So the completly opposite way of thinking. 
"For over 2000 years, objects tend to stop on their own, "
"if you want to keep the movement, apply a force. "
"These guys say, "
Objects hava tendency to maintain their motion forever 
and the only way that your going to stop them is 
"if you act on it, or accelerate them, or change their velocity, "
"so either their speed or direction some way, "
is to act on them with an unbalanced force. 
"But you might be saying, "
"Hey, come on Sal, what's going on? "
"You just went through this, "
"you said for most of most of human history, "
"including my own personal history, "
this is what I observed [top right]. 
How can these guys say that this thing has a tendency to 
go on forever? 
This seems to break down. 
"And their big insight was, "
"well, maybe these things don't have, by themselves, "
"a tendency to stop, but because of interactions "
"with their enviorment, forces are being generated "
that are acting against their motion. 
"So when you think you're leaving this thing alone, "
there is actualy a net force that is trying to stop it. 
"And in this particular example over here, "
the net force is the force of friction. 
It's the interaction between the block and the ground. 
"So, when you think you're leaving this thing alone, "
"you actually have a net force going against it's motion, "
which is the force of friction. 
"And these guys realize that, "
"because they said, "
"look, if it was an innate property of the block, "
"regardelss of the enviornment, "
it should kind of always come to a stop 
in maybe a similar way. 
"But they saw, if you made this surface a little bit smoother "
this thing would travel further and further. 
"Maybe if you eliminated this friction, "
"if you made this surface completely friction-less, "
"completely smooth, this thing indead would travel forever. "
"And they didn't have the luxury of launching satilites, "
"and doing things in deep space, "
"so it was a very, very unintuitive thought experiment. "
"And you might say, what about this other thing, "
what happens when I am applying the force? 
"Becuase in my everyday life, "
If I want to drag my TV set across the room 
I apply a force to it. 
And what these guys would tell you 
"is all you were doing, "
"if you were keeping the velocity of that TV constant, "
all you were doing was counteracting this net negative force. 
"So if this was a TV dragging across your carpet, "
this is the force of friction acting against the motion 
"of the object, "
and so you are essentially just balancing it when you push it. 
"If you balance it perfectly, "
you will be able to maintain it's velocity. 
"If you want to accelerate it, "
you will have to apply even more force in the direction you are actually moving it. 
Many thanks to Sal! :)

"Let's say the 2011 nominal GDP is: 15,294.3 billion dollars. "
And I didn't just make this number up. 
This is actually the advanced estimate of what 2011 GDP was in the fourth quarter. 
This is just a fourth quarter number. 
"They took the fourth quarter number and they that analysed this to get to this 15 000 billion, which is esentially 15,294.3 trillion dollars of GDP. "
"Let's say the GDP deflator, relative to 2010, you always have to know what you're taking your deflator relative to, "
"is a 102.5 and this is, once again, the 2011 GDP deflator. "
"And one way to interprate this is if the base year is 2010, that means that prices in 2010 could be viewed as being at 100 "
"and that now, we're in 2011, we're in 102.5. "
"Another way to think about is that generall level of prices, that we have talked about it, this is not an easy thing to measure "
"But if attempted to that the generall level of prices has gone up by 2.5 %, when form 100 to 102.5. "
"Now that is the way that we know the nominal GDP is, the GDP measured in 2011 dollars,ofen called the current dollar GDP. "
"We know the deflator is, can we figure out the real GDP in 2011 "
"and that will be the real GDP in 2010 dollars, when we have the deflator relative to 2010. "
"So to do that we just have to remember that the ratio between our nominal GDP and our real GDP is going to be the ratio, "
you can viewed as current dollar vs. 2010 dollars. 
"Or another way of viewing it, is the ratio between our deflator, which is 102.5 "
"and 100, which is esentially you could use it as kind of deflator in 2010 "
"or just setting that level of prices to be 100, a prices now are 102.5 . "
"So taking it in that way, our nominal current dollar GDP is 15 294.3 billion dollars "
"we can viewed that it's 15.2943 trillion, eiter way. "
Our real GDP is what we want to figure out. 
We do not know what it is. 
"But we know the deflator, we know that things are gotten 102.5 more expensive "
or that deflator is a 102.5. 
And then we can just solve for the real GDP. 
"And the 102.5 over 100, you might be able do this in your head, "
this whole expression right over here just becomes 1.025. 
And so you have this 15 trillions divided by 1.025 or you can divide both sides by 1.025 
and multiply both sides by the real GDP. 
"So let's do that. Multiply both sides by the real GDP, divide both sides by 1.025. "
"Now, of course, this cancels with that, that why we have multiplay both sides by the real, "
And then this cancels with that and we get our real GDP. 
Our real GDP is equal to our current dollar GDP. 
"15 294.3 billion dollars divided by essentially the ratio between our deflator and the 100, divided by 1.025. "
If I were in charge of naming macroeconomic concepts I would actually made this the deflator 
"I would set this at 1 and I would call this 1.205, because then you wouldn't had all this sillines multiplaing and dividing by 100. "
"You just say: Hey, let's take our current dollar GDP, divide it by the deflator, I guess you could say world - deflated, to get the real GDP. "
That's just make a lot of sense to me. 
"But either way, that's essencially what simplify too, this is our current dollar GDP, our nominal GDP "
"dividing it by, what I would prefer to call the deflator, but you could use it as the deflator divided by 100 "
and that gave us a real GDP. 
"We just deflating the current dollar one, and how many the calculate to figure this one out. "
"So let's get the calculator out, so 15 294.3, this is in billions, divided by 1.025, gives us 14 921.3 "
So let me take this to the screen that I can remember that says. I have a bad memory. 
"This is our real GDP, our real GDP is equal to 14 921.3 billion dollars. "
You can also write 14.9213 trillion dollars.

Control 
Haas Control 
New Graphical User Interface 
My name is John Nelson with Haas Automation 
We have created this video to introduce you to the new graphical user interface 
That will be appearing on selected Haas machines beginning in October of 2007 
Graphical user interface is a fancy term for new screen layout 
What we have done with the new screens is reorganize them into three general modes 
To give users access to every control feature needed in that mode without having to leave the current display screen 
"The three modes are “Set-Up”, “Operation”, and “Edit” "
"Along the way we added many new features and enhancements, so lets get started with our introduction "
The keypad has not changed at all and virtually every key performs its same function as before 
"While the screens look very different, the control works very much the same "
"So to begin, I press [RESET] to clear the alarms and [POWER UP/RESTART] to home the machine "
"Notice at the top of the screen, that we are immediately in “Setup” mode and the active function is Zero Return "
Handle Jog is also a function within “Setup” mode 
"so to begin, I’ll press the [HAND JOG] key and I am ready to begin setting up my offsets "
Let’s take a look around the screen at the different boxes of information 
The active “Program” box is displayed in the upper left 
The tool offsets are displayed to the right 
Below the tool offsets are the work zero offsets 
"Along the bottom, we have the spindle information box "
"with the override values for spindle speed, feed rate, and rapid rate "
"Next to that is the “Position” box showing operator, work offset, machine, and distance-to-go coordinates "
"Here, to the right, is the “Tool Management” information "
Below is where status messages like “Single Block” and “Block Delete” are displayed 
"Along the bottom, in the old familiar place, is the data input box "
Notice the “Tool Offset” box is white and the rest of the boxes are colored 
This signals that the focus is on the “Tool Offsets” box 
Pressing the arrow keys immediately begins moving the cursor around this box 
I put the cursor on the length offset for tool 1 
Press the [TOOL OFFSET MEASURE] key 
And my first tool is set 
"I press the [NEXT TOOL] key, same as always, and I’m ready to go with tool 2 "
"In previous versions of the Haas control, if I wanted to go to the work zero offsets, I would press the [OFFSET] key "
It’s the same with the new control 
Now when I press the [OFFSET] key 
The focus changes to the “Work Zero Offset” box 
And I scroll around this box to set my offsets 
Both offset boxes look very much the same as before 
Except that we have added this column for tool type in the “Tool Offset” box 
You have the ability to define your cutters as one of five tool types 
The available types are 
Drill 
Tap 
Shell Mill 
End Mill 
and Spot Drill 
Another feature added to the control is the ability to sort offsets 
By pressing the [F3] key with the focus on an offset screen 
You can sort all the offsets by whichever column the cursor is on 
"For example, if you move the cursor over to the “Tool Type” column and press [F3] "
The control will display the tool offsets in order by the tool type 
This will come in handy when you need to look at all the different drills you have in the machine 
The final change to the tool offset display is the addition of the “Pocket-Tool” table here in the “Tool Offset” box 
"Before we move on to the next screen, note that I can jog the machine axis without leaving the display "
"Well, I’ve got my offsets set now so I need to load my program "
"I press the same button as always, [LIST PROG] "
"Notice, at the top of the screen, I am now in “Edit” mode and List is the active function "
The “List Program” screen now has tabs to navigate the different devices connected to the machine 
The program I want is on my USB memory stick 
So I connect it to the machine 
Watch the control recognize it 
"Cursor over to the ""USB Device"" and press the [WRITE / ENTER] key "
It displays all the files on my USB memory stick 
"If I wanted to load several files, I could press the [WRITE / Enter] key when the files I want are highlighted "
and the control marks those files with a check mark 
"Now, the next function I select like Delete or Copy will happen to all the marked files "
"I only want to copy this one program, so I’m going to press the [UNDO] key to remove the checkmarks "
I press the [F2] key to bring up the “Copy To” dialog box 
I highlight the device I want to copy the program to 
In this case “Memory” 
And press the [WRITE / ENTER] key 
For a complete list and description of all the functions of list programs and file navigation 
Press the [HELP CALC] key to access the quick-key help menu 
"We have the command name, the associated key for each function "
And at the bottom of the menu is a full description of how to perform each function 
There are now extensive quick-key help menus from many screens in the new control 
I need to make a quick change to my program so I will press the [EDIT] key like I have always done 
"Notice along the top of the screen, I am in “Edit” mode and Edit is the function "
This area of the screen has changed quite a bit so let’s look around 
"Here, in the upper-left corner is the active “Program Edit” box "
Notice this note in the title bar 
“Cycle start to simulate” 
"In “Edit”, I can press [CYCLE START] to go directly to graphics mode and run a program "
And now we have the ability to speed up and slow down the graphics processing speed with the [F3] and [F4] keys 
I press [RESET] to go back to “Edit” mode 
"Over here, to the right, I have the program list "
I press [EDIT] one more time and the focus changes to this side of the screen 
I scroll to select a second program I want to edit 
And that program is available for editing 
"Down here in the lower-left corner, I have the ""Editor Help"" box "
"When I press [F1], I get the advanced editor like I used to "
As I scroll around the topics in the advanced editor 
"The help description for each topic is displayed in the ""Edit"" help box "
"We now have a viewable clipboard in the bottom-right side of the ""Edit"" screen "
"Any time you cut or copy a selection to the clipboard, it will be displayed in the ""Clipboard"" box "
You can also use this as a storage area for text or code commands that you repeatedly paste into your programs 
"The third function under the ""Edit"" mode is MDI "
"When I press the [MDI] key, I get the same manual data input screen as before "
One press of the [PRGRM CONVRS] key toggles me between this box 
and the Visual Quick Code Programming system and the Intuitive Programming System 
if they are activated on this machine 
"Our final mode is ""Operation"" mode "
"As you might well guess, I enter ""Operation"" mode by pressing the [MEM] key "
"In ""Operation"" mode, we have all the information needed to run the machine organized and available for access "
"Again, the upper-left corner is the ""Program"" display box "
While executing programs that run sub-programs 
both the main program and the sub program will be displayed in a split-screen box 
Next are the active G-codes with text descriptions 
Coolant level indicator 
"And the active tool information including the graphic image of the tool type taken from the ""Tool Offset"" page "
In the center of the screen is the offset window 
This box is ready for any offset adjustment while the machine is running 
I don’t have to exit this screen to change an offset 
"Along the bottom, we have the spindle information box with the override display "
"In the center is the ""Position"" display box "
"And to the right, ""Timers and Counters"" "
"As an experienced machinist, one of my favorite new features is this little display here "
This is titled “Remaining” 
"The ""Remaining"" timer uses the information from the ""Last Cycle"" timer to display the time remaining in a program "
"In a production environment, this will allow the operator to know how much time is remaining in the cycle "
and make better time-management decisions when leaving the machine 
"Now, let’s go back to the keypad "
Every button on the left side of the keypad performs the exact same function in the exact same way 
with the exception of [F3] and [F4] 
[F3] now slows down the speed of the graphics and [F4] speeds up the graphics 
"Obviously, there has been no change to the function of the letter keys and the number keys "
as well as the cursor navigation keys 
So that leaves displays 
When I press the [PRGRM/CONVERS] key 
The focus changes to the active program box 
"When I press the [POSIT] key, the focus changes to the ""Position"" display box "
More presses toggle through the four position displays just like previous versions of the Haas control 
"Pressing the [OFFSET] key changes the focus to the ""Offset"" box "
"And successive presses toggles between the ""Tool Offsets"" and the ""Work Zero Offsets"" "
"Pressing the [CURNT COMDS] key displays the ""Macro Variables"" page "
And pressing [PAGE UP] or [PAGE DOWN] from here toggles through the same pages as before 
"The new user settable ""Operation Timers and Set-Up"" page has been added to current commands "
This page allows you to reset your timers and counters as before 
but also allows you to monitor the value of up to two macro variables at the same time 
You can enter a custom name for the variable 
the variable number 
and the control will always display the value of that variable 
There is no change to the alarm message display other than the added quick-key help screens 
The last key is the [HELP CALC] key 
We have re-grouped the Help and Calculator functions into the tab format 
"Under ""Help"", we have sub-tabs for ""G-Code"" and ""M-Code"" lists "
"""Features"", which is a quick overview of the topics covered in this video "
"and ""Index"" "
"The ""Index"" sub-tab is a wealth of information on the Haas control and should be read before operating the machine "
"Along with the ""Help"" tab, there is the ""Drill Table"" tab, which is a tap/drill chart, and the ""Calculator"" tab "
"As you can see, the look of the Haas control has changed quite a bit "
"In reality, the operation of the machine "
and how the user performs functions on the machine has not changed much at all 
We realize change can be difficult 
"but we believe after a short time working with this new Haas control, you will be hooked "
and realize that the most user-friendly machine tool control in the world just got much better

""
In the last few videos we wrote a nice little program here 
that asks the user for some type of input 
and then computes the factorial of that number 
and then prints it out. 
"And thats nice, but you could imagine a world where "
you would want to calculate the factorial in multiple places 
or in multiple different programs 
or in the same program you want to calculate 
the factorial multiple times. 
And you don't want to write this code 
over and over again every time 
you want to calculate the factorial. 
"So what I'm gonna to in this video, "
is define a function that calculates the factorial 
and then we could use that function 
ever time we want to calculate the factorial. 
"So essentially what this function is going to do, "
"is going to put all this code, "
"all of this code right here, "
in one place and then any other 
"program that i want to calculate the factorial, "
i can just recall that code. 
I don't have to rewrite it. 
So let me just show you what I'm talking about. 
So I'm going to define a function 
"and the keyword in Python, "
so it is kind of a special word 
that tells the interpret that something 
special is about to happen. 
"The keyword in Python for defining a function is ""def"". "
"So I'm going to define a function, "
I'm going to call it the factorial function. 
And it tends to be a good idea 
to name things in indicative of what they actually do. 
Sometimes beginning programmers have a habit of 
"naming things like ""x245"" "
and someone who comes in later 
will have no clue what variable 
or that function is all about. 
So you definitely somehow name it 
so it gives an idea what is supposed to do. 
My function is called factorial 
"and the user when they call factorial, "
they need to tell factorial 
what number I'm going to take the factorial of. 
"So they gonna pass it in argument called ""number"". "
And if these words look a little confusing 
i will explain them in detail in a second 
but you can just hopefully the more you see this 
the more familiar you will get with these ideas. 
And so they gonna pass it number 
and I'm just going to have to return back 
to the calling program 
and I actually shouldn't have said 
"that the user is going to pass the number, "
the calling program is going to pass the number 
and I need to return back the factorial of that number 
to the calling program. 
So let me write this down as a comment actually. 
"So returns the factorial of the argument ""number"". "
And sometimes you will hear the word parameter 
and sometimes you'll hear the word argument. 
"When you are making a definition of a function, "
this is more formally called a parameter. 
"""Number"" is one of the parameters "
to the factorial function. 
"The actual number that someone else passes to it, "
"so let's say someone calls factorial with a ""3"" here, "
then more formally that 3 would be the argument. 
"So returns the factorial of the argument ""number"". "
"And this is the argument ""number"" right over here. "
I don't mean this just is like arbitrarily the word number 
I'm literally talking about this number over here. 
"Maybe I will say the argument ""number"". "
Maybe I will put it in quotes to make it clear 
"that this is the argument, "
I'm not talking about any general number. 
Let's define it. 
"So we are going to use the same code essentially, "
"actually let me just copy and paste, "
let me just copy and past a lot of what i took over here. 
So I'm going to cut that out 
and I'm going to re-paste it over here 
but i have to be careful about my indentations 
cause indentations are how Python knows 
"whats part of what, it knows how to interpret things. "
So everything that is part of this function definition 
has to be indented and we do it by four spaces. 
"One, two, three, four. "
And this is another four. 
"One, two, three, four. "
And this is part of the for-loop. 
"One, two, three, four. "
And let's think about what we have so far. 
"It is going to be passed some number, "
"we define this variable ""product"" equals 1. "
And we will talk more about scoping of variables 
but this variable is only going to be useable 
within this factorial definition 
because the first time I define it right here 
is inside of this right here 
so we will go more into scoping of variables in the future. 
"And then with the same logic we did before, "
"""for i in range(number)"", "
now we are not getting the number using the input function 
"it is just being passed to the function, "
"then ""product"" is equal to ""product"" x (""i""+1). "
Same logic as we had before. 
"So after you go through this for-loop, "
"after you go through it, "
"you are essentially going to go through it ""number"" times. "
"""Product"" will have in it the factorial of ""number"". "
"And instead of outputting it directly, "
"what we wanna do is return, "
we are going to return it to the calling program 
and in the next video I'm going to diagram this out 
a little bit cleaner if this seems a little bit confusing to you. 
I'm going to return product. 
So it is essentially the exact same code as we had before 
"but we have packaged it inside of a function, "
we have defined a function. 
"It takes in, it has a parameter called a ""number"", "
if you want a factorial of 3 
you try the factorial of 3 
and 3 would be the argument the thing 
"that is being put in the place of the variable ""number"" "
"or the thing that ""number"" is referring to. "
"You define ""product"" is equal to 1 "
"and then you go ""number"" times. "
"So ""for i in range(number)"", "
we have explained the logic of that in the previous video. 
"Everytime you start with 1, "
"then you do 1 x 1 is going to be 1, "
"then ""product"" is going to be 1 "
"but then ""i"" is going to be 1. "
"""i"" starts off at zero, "
"so it is going to be 1 x (0 + 1) gives you 1, "
"then ""i"" is 2, so it's going to be 1 x 1, "
"sorry, then ""i"" is 1 "
"it is going to be 1 x (1 + 1), which is 1 x 2, "
so it is going to be 2 then 
and it will incrementing that way 
and we explained it in detail in the last video. 
"And then finally it is going to return that ""product"". "
So if we want to have the same exact behavior as before 
but now we are using this function. 
"What we could do is, we could say, "
"we still have the input, so this is our function definition "
"but then along our main program, "
we have defined our function 
and now we could just say: 
"""Look, from the user get a non-negative integer "
"to take the factorial of"" "
"And let's put that into, "
"lets call that a variable called ""user_input"". "
And then what I'm going to do 
is I'm going to define another variable 
"to called ""factorial<u>of</u>user_input"" "
and now this is going to be interesting. 
"I'm going to call this function up here, "
so this is going to be equal to 
factorial of whatever the user had input. 
"So the factorial of ""user_input"", "
the factorial of this variable right over here. 
The factorial of user input. 
"So now ""factorial<u>of</u>user_input"" will be storing, "
"I guess we should say, "
it would be pointing to the actual answer 
and now we just have to print it out. 
"So now we can print ""factorial<u>of</u>user_input"". "
They look like sentences 
but these are just variable names 
that I'm naming this way 
so you really now what's inside of those variables 
or what those variables are really pointing to. 
"So ""factorial<u>of</u>user_input"". "
"Now, you know the moment of truth "
is always saving the program and actually trying to run it. 
So lets try to run it right now and see what happens. 
Let's see what happens here. 
"So at least nothing broke so far, "
"so once again, "
so I want to be clear the program started here 
but up here all we did is defined this 
"so it is not creating any interaction with the user, "
"it is actually not processing anything just yet, "
so it just defines this function then it goes down here 
"and says: ""Okay, get some input form the user"" "
and thats what we are doing right here. 
"After we input some number here, "
then it's gonna actually call this function with that number 
"that we put, the number that we put, "
"is gonna go put in the ""user_input"" "
and then it is gonna call factorial 
"with ""user_input"" as an argument. "
So let's try with the number 3. 
And it did not work! 
"Oh, and I see why it did not work "
because I had this leftover from the previous program 
which actually makes no sense now. 
So let me get rid of that. 
It is a good lesson that seldom on the first 
try does something work perfectly. 
Let me try it again! 
That was just nonsense 
that i didn't even realize what was down there. 
So let me try it again. 
So 3 again. 
And it gave me a good answer. 
It gave me the factorial of 3 
and what's cool now is because 
now my python interpreter 
is assuming that this definition has been made 
"I can now call the factorial straight from the interpreter, "
if I had another program 
I could call it multiple ways 
and now you should hopefully appreciate 
why it is cool that we made this function definition 
"cause we can calculate, "
"cause I've defined this function factorial, "
I can calculate the factorial of 4. 
It is 24. 
I can say that the factorial of 5 - the factorial of 3. 
114. 
I can take the factorial of 12 
"and you can tell the computer, "
"even though it is just interpreting all this, "
"we will talk more interpreted vs compile code, "
it's incredibly fast. 
Faster then we can really even fathom. 
"So this is the real power of a function, "
"is that I don't have to rewrite code every time now, "
I can just call it with different arguments. 
"So factorial of 2, I can do it every time, "
I don't have to rerun the program. 
"And if I write other programs that use factorial, "
"maybe I do something in combinatorics, "
"I can just use this as a function, "
infact I don't even have to know 
what is going on inside the function. 
That's one of the other powerful aspects of functions is 
"that let's say i write a bunch of programs that call, "
so i have this program right here that calls factorial. 
But let's say you come up with a better way of 
writing this right over here. 
As long as your program 
"that does the same thing with different guts, "
the end user won't notice. 
So maybe you write a faster way 
or a simpler way of doing this. 
The way that uses less memory or less CPU power. 
Then you could just replace this later on 
"and then any program that calls it, "
"as long as it still works, "
it will work for that program 
and it will just work that much better. 
""
How is it we should measure information in a way that
"human, animal or alien?"
"where, at the time, we were focused –"
as we are today – on speed.
One goal to improve speed
was to design a machine which allowed
which we can think of as 'primary symbols' –
and have the machine automate
the lower-level signaling events 
such as pulses of electricity 
[which] we can call 'secondary symbols.'
allowing [them] to generate a precise and
"rapid pulse stream, which presumably"
would run much faster than any human hand.
One great example of this was
the 'Baudot multiplex system.'
The design was put into service in 1874.
It built off [of] the same conceptual ideas
we've seen in the shutter telegraph.
"It consisted of five keys, which could be"
played in any combination.
Think of a chord.
Each combination would
each either 'on' or 'off' –
"So the operator would literally play letters,"
and their machine would automatically output
a pulse stream representing the letters.
"Like this, for letter T."
"Or like this, for letter R."
"Or like this, for letter B."
So we have an output signal containing
a signal that accurately represents
the message typed on the teletypewriter.
"Behind the counter, the mechanical nerves"
"of the system change words to holes on tape,"
and the holes on tape to electrical impulses –
speeding over the wires.
"Notice, at the lowest level, this system"
is exchanging either the presence or absence
of electrical current – in a sequence divided using a clock.
"So, how fast can our internal clocks run?"
"Well, the [factor] limiting [the] speed was not the clock."
was physically limited by the minimum spaces
between these impulses –
or the 'pulse rate.'
And this problem plagued engineers who were
"testing underground [and] submarine cables,"
using the existing Morse-code system.
"If one sends dots too fast over a long, undersea circuit,"
they will run together at the receiving end –
not an exact replica.
Sending pulses too fast
results in inter-symbol interference.
"This occurs, for example,"
when the longer flow of a current
"bleeds into the next time division,"
"and, perhaps, reverses a 0 to a 1."
"So, even if we're automating"
there is a fundamental limit
to how [closely] we can squeeze two pulses together.
And this is the same problem
Alice and Bob ran into
with their string-communication system –
which we called the 'maximum pluck speed.'
If they plucked any faster than two plucks
"per second, they noticed [their signals]"
and they got confused.
So this is called the 'symbol rate.'
"Remember, a 'symbol' can be broadly defined"
which persists for a fixed period of time.
electrical current  – anything  –
from one state to another.
So the 'symbol rate'
is the number of signaling events
which can be squeezed together in 1 second.

"So it's pretty clear that if you were raising around to capital, going to friends and family "
"or crowdfunding like Kickstarter or angel capital or venture capital or corporate partners, "
all kind of make sense for financing. 
"Also, going to the small business administration or getting SBIR grants "
also fit into the financing column. 
But for operating capital that is money you need when your company is an ongoing concern 
"in generating revenue--well, lease lines make sense, factoring, vendor financing. "
And what's really interesting is you might also get operating capital from government grants as well 
and corporate partners that are also fit there. 
So there's two actually went into the correct category. 
"Well, surprisingly of course venture capital always does follow on rounds "
so this was kind of a trick question. 
You could always get more operating capital in subsequent rounds 
"from venture capitalist, not on the corporate partners. "

"So for teller sales, I thought the best answer was toner. "

"And for system integrators, putting together a telecommunications network is their expertise. "
""
"&gt;&gt; Well, the database that was here at SLAC was used by people around the "
"world, but with great difficulty because they had to have an account on mainframe. "
"Most people weren't familiar with mainframes. And second of all, the "
"database language that you had to type in was difficult. So before there was a web, "
I invented a way for people to do what's now called Instant Messaging. And to do a 
query to the database without logging in. And that improve access to the database 
"but still have this terrible language of the database machine to, to type in, in "
"order to do your query. A little later on, people added the e-mail interface so you "
"could send your query by e-mail and you'd get your response back by e-mail. So, when "
"I was at CERN in September 1991, and Tim Berners-Lee dragged me into his office to "
"show me, to give me a demo of the web, when he demo, at first I wasn't very "
interested but when he demonstrated doing a query to a help system database on a 
"mainframe, I really put two and two together and says, well if you can query a "
"help system on a mainframe, you can query a database on the mainframe. Then I "
"started getting interested. The thing is that, that we couldn't change the query "
commands because that was built in the database. But the web page could give you 
"examples and remind you what the query would be. ≫&gt; So did you, have to "
"write it all from scratch? I mean, did you write it from the protocol? Or was there "
"software that you used to make your first web server? ≫&gt; Well, I used CERN "
"server software which was written in C. Unfortunately, we had a C compiler on the "
"mainframe at the time, that time. It wasn't very long that we had a mainframe "
"on a C compiler, but we had one. So, all I had to do was to write some extra C code "
"to get the, get the query that the user had made and turn it into a database "
"query. It was December twelve, 1991 when we installed our, our web server. And we, "
we informed Tim Berners-Lee that day to give it a try. The big boost came about a 
"month later in January, in Southern France, where there was a workshop on "
"computing topics for high energy and nuclear physics. And at that workshop, Tim "
Berners-Lee had a plenary talk. So he gave his hour long talk to about 200 physicists 
"from around the world. And, as part of his talk, he gave a demo. And at the very end, "
the most people who I think were bored most of the time to me. The worst thing 
that software people want to think about is documentation and he was pitching 
"documentation. But at the end of the talk, he connected to the SLAC web server and "
"made a query. And that really dropped a lot of jaw, jaws, because the instant "
"everybody knew the database, everybody knew how hard it was to access. Okay? And "
"here he just clicked away typed in a few things for the query term and bang, the "
"results came back nicely formatted. So, I, the way I say it the interest in the web "
"went from about twenty people to 200 people in that hour, okay? Now those 200 "
"people went back home, and if each one of them called ten people then within a week, "
"the interest in the web would have grown to 2,000 people. So, that, that was the "
"big turning point and I think Tim recognizes that, that was really the "
"kickoff. And I think the, the reason that, the, the web took off so quickly once the "
"commerce, appreciated, and started to realize it, it's a win, win situation. "
Okay? It's a win for the customer obviously because he can do price 
"comparisons, he can browse his airline schedules for, on his own. Visualize what "
"he want's to see quickly, and cut and try different things as much patience as he "
"has to get the price down. So it's much, much better for the consumer. But what "
"about the provider|? The airlines? Well, it's much better for them because it's "
"just software that's running on machines, okay? It's much lower cost for, for them. "
"And, and so they're winning, too. I point out my talk about the web near the end, "
"sort of a punchline, that in doing big science, we're solving, we're finding "
"solutions to problems tha t the general public don't know they have. So, who would "
"predict that out of high energy physics research you would come, something like "
"the web would, would come up? I think that would be unpredictable. But, in hindsight, "
"you can see that it was a natural place for, for the web to have been invented. "
""
"In the last video, we figured out what is the present value"
of these three different payment timing choices.
"If we had a 5% risk-free rate, and if these payments were"
"risk-free, instead of coming from -- you can almost view"
"them as some type of government program, where"
they're asking you to choose which of these three payment
And so we'll use the same rate that the government would pay
"you, if you lent them money."
And that's given by the treasury rate.
And in the first case we assumed a 5% treasury rate.
"And if you watched the first present value video, I think"
you understand why compounding going forward is the same
thing as discounting that rate by going backwards.
"If you want to know how much $100 is a year from now, you"
"multiply that times one plus the interest rate, right?"
"So if it's 5%, you multiply that times 1.05."
"If you're taking $110 and going a year back,"
you divide by 1.05.
So it's just the same operation.
You're just going forward or back.
"Forward is multiplication, backwards is division."
"But anyway, the result that we got in the last video is that"
the present value -- let me do this in a different color.
And I'll introduce my notation.
"The present value, if we assume a 5% rate, no matter"
how long-- how far away the money is given to you.
And you'll see what I mean because I'll change that
assumption in a second.
"But if we assume that the risk-free rate is 5%, then the"
"present value of $100 today, well that was just $100."
"$110 in two years, we got that by doing 110 divided by 1.05"
"squared, right?"
"You divide by 1.05 there, and then you divide by 1.05 again."
And then you get $99.77.
I don't want to run out of too much space.
I could have probably done this whole thing
a little bit bigger.
And then choice number three.
How did we get that?
"Well, we said -- let me do that in a different color."
"That was the present value of the $20 today, plus $50 in one"
"year, divided by that, discounted to the present day."
So divided by 1.05 plus $35 divided by 1.05 squared.
And we had gotten $99.36.
"And that's what that should be worth to you today, if you"
"assume that these payments are risk-free, and you use a 5%"
discount rate.
Fair enough.
"And based on these calculations, choice number"
"one was the best, choice number two was second best,"
choice number three was third best. Fair enough.
"Now what happens -- after I pose the question, you might"
want to think about it before I show you the answer -- what
happens if I don't assume a 5% discount rate?
What happens if I assume a 2% discount rate?
This is just my notation.
What is the present value of these if I assume a 2%
"risk-free rate, or a 2% discount rate?"
"Well $100, I'm getting that today, so"
that's still worth $100.
You could even do that as -- let me do that in a more
vibrant color -- as 100 divided by 1.02 to the 0
"power, because we're getting it today."
"But that's just 1.02 divided by 1, which is just $100."
$100 today.
What's the present value?
It's $100.
Now what's the $110 two years out going to be worth?
So this is interesting.
"When the interest rate goes down, from 5% to 2%, I'm going"
to be dividing by a smaller number.
1.02 squared is a smaller number than 1.05 squared.
So the present value of this payment should go up.
Interesting.
"This is something to keep in mind for later, when we start"
thinking about bonds.
"When you lower the interest rate, the present value of"
this future payment goes up.
Discounted twice.
"Oh, and how did I get that?"
That was equal to -- I'm doing it in reverse here -- that was
equal to 110 divided by 1.02 squared.
And our intuition was correct.
"Just by the interest rate going from 5% to 2%, the"
present value of this payment two years out -- it's in year
"three, but it's two years out."
Actually I should re-label this.
"I should call this now, the present."
I should call this year one.
"I was calling this year two, one year out."
But I think that makes it confusing.
"I called this year two, so this is now."
So you could call this year zero.
This is year one.
And this is year two.
The present value of this is -- it increased by $6 just by
the discount rate going down by 3%.
Fascinating.
Now let's see what happens to choice number three.
"Choice number three, the $20 today, the $20 now, well"
that's just worth $20.
"Its present value is 20 plus 50 divided by 1.02, plus the"
35 divided by 1.02 squared.
20 plus 50 divided by 1.02 plus 35
$102.66.
Now there's a couple of really interesting things.
And this is a really good time to kind of let it all sink in.
All of a sudden we lowered the interest rate.
"And now choice number two is the best, followed by choice"
"number three, followed by choice number one."
So it almost -- choice number one was the best when we had a
5% discount rate.
"Now at a 2% discount rate, choice number two is all of a"
sudden the best.
And there's something else interesting here.
Choice number two improved by a lot more when we lowered the
"interest rate, than choice number three did."
"Its present value went from $99.77 to $105.70,"
so it's almost $6.
"While here it only improved by less than $3, right?"
So why is that?
"Well, when you lower the interest rate, the terms that"
"are using that discount rate the most, benefit the most. So"
"all of this payment was two years out, right?"
"So it benefited the most by decreasing the discount rate,"
It changed this value the most.
These payments are spread out.
Only some of its payment is two years out.
"Then some of its payment is one year out, and that's going"
to benefit less.
And then some of its payment is today.
"So it will benefit, because you are discounting some of"
the cash payments.
But it's going to benefit by less.
"Anyway, I'll leave you there in this video."
"And in the next video, we're going to see what happens when"
we have different discount rates for
different amounts of time.

"I'm here with Jesse Ro, whose a math teacher at Summit San Jose "
and a Khan Academy teaching fellow 
and you had some interesting ideas or questions. 
"Yeah, one question that students ask a lot when they start Algebra "
"is why do we need letters, why can't we just use numbers for everything? "
Why letters? So why do we have all these 
Xs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra? 
"Yeah, exactly. "
"That's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second. "
"So Sal, how would you answer this question? "
Why do we need letters in Algebra? 
So why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it. 
One is if you have an unknown. 
So if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten 
the reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is 
It's literally an unknown. 
And so we're going to solve for it in some way. 
But it did not have to be the letter X. 
We could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten. 
Or we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten. 
"So it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol. "
It literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten. 
"But until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is. "
Now we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents. 
"But if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown. "
It wouldn't be something that we didn't know. 
So that's one reason why I would use letters 
and where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful. 
The other is when you're describing relationships between numbers. 
So I could do something like - I could say - that 
"whenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four. "
"And I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six. "
And i could keep going on and on forever. 
"If you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1. "
And I could keep listing this on and on forever. 
"Maybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you. "
But I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them. 
And we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship. 
"Maybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y. "
"And so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it. "
And that's what I'm going to give back to you. 
"And so now, this very simple equation here "
can describe an infinite number of relationships between X 
or an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs. 
So now someone knows whatever X you give me 
"you give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four. "
"You give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1. "
So there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols. 
"With that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys. "
This is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history. 
I could've defined what you give me as Star 
and what I give you as Smiley Face 
and this also would've been a valid way to express this. 
So the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more. 
""
In the last video we did a couple of lattice multiplication problems 
and we saw it was pretty straightforward. 
You got to do all your multiplication first 
and then do all of your addition. 
"Well, let's try to understand why exactly it worked. "
It almost seemed like magic. 
And to see why it worked I'm going to redo this problem up here 
and then I'll also try to explain what we did in the longer problems. 
So when we multiplied twenty-seven-- 
so you write your two and your seven just like that-- times forty-eight. 
I'm just doing exactly what we did in the previous video. 
"We drew a lattice, gave the two a column and the seven a column. "
Just like that. 
We gave the four a row and we gave the eight a row. 
And then we drew our diagonal. 
"And the key here is the diagonals, as you can imagine, "
otherwise we wouldn't be drawing them. 
So you have your diagonals. 
Now the way to think about it 
is each of these diagonals are a number place. 
"So for example, this diagonal right here, that is the ones place. "
"The next diagonal, I'll do it in this light green color. "
"The next diagonal right here in the light green color, "
that is the tens place. 
"Now the next diagonal to the left or above that, depending on how you want to view it, "
I'll do in this little pink color right here. 
"You could guess, that's going to be the hundreds place. "
"And then, finally, we have this little diagonal there, "
and I'll do it in this light blue color. 
That is the thousands place. 
"So whenever we multiply one digit times another digit, "
we just make sure we put it in the right bucket 
or in the right place. 
And you'll see what I mean in a second. 
So we did seven times four. 
"Well, we know that seven times four is twenty-eight. "
We just simply wrote a two and an eight just like that. 
But what did we really do? 
"And I guess the best way to think about it, this seven-- "
this is the seven in twenty-seven. 
So it's just a regular seven. Right? 
"But this four, it's the four in forty-eight. "
"So it's not just a regular four, it's really a forty. "
Forty-eight can be rewritten as forty plus eight. 
This four right here actually represents a forty. 
"So right here we're not really multiplying seven times four, "
we're actually multiplying seven times forty. 
"And seven times forty isn't just twenty-eight, it's two hundred eighty. "
"And two hundred eighty, how can we think about that? "
We could say that's two hundreds plus eight tens. 
And that's exactly what we wrote right here. 
"Notice: this column-- I'm sorry, this diagonal right here, "
"I already told you, it was the tens diagonal. "
And we multiplied seven times forty. 
We put the eight right here in the tens diagonal. 
So that means eight tens. 
Seven times forty is two hundreds. 
We wrote a two in the hundreds diagonal. 
And eight tens. 
That's what this two eight here is. 
We actually wrote two hundred and eighty. 
Let's keep going. 
When I multiply two times four. 
"You might say, oh, two times four, that's eight. "
But what am I really doing? 
This is the two in twenty-seven. 
This is really a twenty and this is really a forty. 
So twenty times forty is equal to just eight with two zeros. 
Is equal to eight hundred. 
And what did we do? 
"We multiplied two times four and we said, oh, two times four is eight. "
We wrote a zero and an eight just like that. 
But notice where we wrote the eight. 
We wrote the eight in the hundreds diagonal. 
Let me make this a different color. 
We wrote it in the one hundreds diagonal. 
So we literally wrote-- 
"even though it looked like we multiplied two times four and saying it's eight, "
"the way we accounted for it, "
we really did twenty times forty is equal to eight hundreds. 
"Remember, this is the hundreds diagonal, "
this whole thing right there. 
And we can keep going. 
When you multiply seven times eight. 
"Remember, this is really seven-- well, this is the seven in twenty-seven, "
so it's just a regular seven. 
"This is the eight in forty-eight, so it's just a regular eight. "
Seven times eight is fifty-six. 
You write a six in the ones place. 
Fifty-six is just five tens and one six. 
So it's five tens in the tens diagonal and one six. Fifty-six. 
"Then when you multiply two times eight, "
"notice, that's not really just two times eight. "
"I mean we did write it's just sixteen when we did the problem over here, "
but we're actually multiplying twenty. 
This is a twenty times eight. 
Twenty times eight is equal to one hundred sixty. 
Or you could say it's one hundred-- 
notice the one in the one hundreds diagonal-- and six tens. 
That's what one hundred sixty is. 
"So what we did by doing this lattice multiplication, "
is we accounted all the digits. The right digits in the right places. 
We put the six in the ones place. 
"We put the six, the five, and the eight in the tens place. "
"We put the one, the eight, and the two in the hundreds place. "
And we put nothing right now in the thousands place. 
"Then, now that we're done with all the multiplication, "
we can actually do our adding up. 
"And then you just keep adding, "
"and if there's something that goes over to the next place, "
you just carry that number. 
"So six in the ones place, well, that's just a six. "
Then you go the tens place. 
Eight plus five plus six is what? 
Eight plus five is thirteen. 
Plus six is nineteen. 
"But notice, we're in the tens place. "
It's nineteen tens or we could say it's nine tens and one hundred. 
"We carry the one up here, if you can see it, into the hundreds place. "
Now we add up all the hundreds. 
One hundred plus two hundred plus eight hundred plus one hundred. 
"Or, what is this? "
One thousand two hundred. 
So you write two in the hundreds place. 
One thousand two hundred is the same thing as two hundreds plus one thousand. 
And now you only have one thousand in your thousands diagonal. 
And so you write that one right there. 
That's exactly how we did it. 
The same reasoning applies to the more complex problem. 
We can label our places. 
This was the ones place right there. 
And it made sense. 
"When we multiplied the nine times the seven, "
those are just literally nines and sevens. It's sixty-three. 
Six tens and three ones. 
This right here is the tens diagonal. 
Then we got six tens and three ones. 
"When we multiplied nine times eighty-- remember, seven hundred eighty-seven, "
"that's the same thing as seven hundreds plus eight tens plus seven, just regular seven ones. "
So this nine times eight is really nine times eighty. 
Nine times eighty is seven hundred twenty. 
Seven hundreds-- this is the hundreds place. 
Seven hundreds and twenty-- two tens just right there. 
And you can keep going. 
"This up here, this is the thousands place. "
This is the ten thousands. 
I'll write it like that. 
This is the hundred thousands place. 
And then this was the millions place. 
"So we did all of our multiplication at once, "
and accounted for things in their proper place based on what those numbers really are. 
"This entry right here, "
"it looks like we just multiplied four times eight and got thirty-two, "
but we actually were multiplying four hundred-- this is a four hundred-- times eighty. 
And four hundred times eighty is equal to three two and three zeros. 
It's equal to thirty-two thousand. 
"And the way we counted for it-- notice, we put a two right there, "
and what diagonal is that? 
That is the thousands diagonal. 
So we say it's two thousand and three ten thousands. 
So three ten thousands and two thousands. 
That's thirty-two thousand. 
So hopefully that gives you an understanding. 
I mean it's fun to maybe do some lattice multiplication and get practice. 
But you know sometimes it looks like this bizarre magical thing. 
But hopefully from this video you understand that all it is 
"is just a different way of keeping track of where the ones, tens, and hundreds place are. "
With the advantage that it's kind of nice 
"and compartmentalized, it doesn't take up a lot of space. "
"And, it allows you to do all your multiplication at once, "
"and then, switch your brain into addition and carrying mode. "
""
One of the issues with CDMA is clearly that everybody is talking at the same 
"time, at the same frequency band. In other words, the frequency re-use "
"factor is one. And, how do we deal with the resulting "
interference? Interference in the air for cellular 
"network is the first example in this course, of something called negative "
"externality. Externality here, roughly speaking, refers "
"to the fact that your happiness also depends on what other people do, okay? "
"Your signal, your cup of tea or coffee, is other transmission's poison. "
And this is what we call a negative externalilty. 
"Now, we will also later look at positive externalities in social and technological "
networks. Sometimes people also call this the 
"tragedy of commons. In a later lecture, we will talk much more "
about tragedy of commons and how to deal with that in social and technological 
"networks. Now, one famous special case of "
interference in the error is so-called near far problem. 
"If we go back to this picture, you see that a mobile station A is much closer to "
"the base station than mobile station B, okay? "
"Your neighbor, or your friend's, let's say, your friend's iPhone might be much "
closer than your Android phone to the base station. 
"Maybe your friend is sitting right beneath the cell tower, the base station. "
"And therefore, the distance it traverses is much shorter, and the signal received "
at the base station is much stronger than yours. 
And it can drown out your signal. And that is what we call the Near-Far 
Problem. The near user will overwhelm the farther 
"away user's signal. Now, there was a simple solution provided "
by Qualcomm in the late '80s that uses the idea of feedback control. 
"Now, later we'll see much more complicated feedback control in a network. "
"In this case, this is a simple one hop from the base station to different mobile "
stations. The degree of freedom here is exactly 
"transmit power, okay? And it says that, well, adjust your "
transmit power based on where you are. It's going to estimate first the channel 
"condition. For example, how much channel loss does "
"your signal suffer? And then, it would reverse that, say, if "
"your channel loss is a factor of two, okay? "
"And the other is a, a factor of 0.9, for example, okay? "
"Then, I will tell you, look, you should multiply your signal strength by a factor "
"of two, and you should multiply by a factor of one over 0.9, which is much "
"smaller than two. Then, this power adjustment would cancel "
"out the effect of the channel attenuation, and then I would have equalized received "
signal power from both of you at the base station. 
"So, this is a simple algorithm. There's no iteration, okay? "
And it is through a central command by the base station. 
And it suffices to achieve equalization of received signal power. 
"And without the speed back control to take up the near-far problem, you would never "
be able to implement CDMA because the amount of interference would be just too 
"much. Now, what if you need to achieve a target "
signal quality which might be different for different mobile stations? 
Not just simply equalize all the received power. 
And that was the challenge in the early '90s. 
"But, in order to make sense of that question, we'll have to provide a little "
"bit of symbol, okay? Now, we're going to look at a very small "
"cell. There only two mobile stations, okay? "
"Two iPhones, one and two, and one base station. "
"Even though there's one physical receiver, we're going to divide it into two logical "
"receivers, okay? Receiver one, receiver two. "
"And, we will look at four different channels, two of them are the so-called "
direct channels. These are the desired intended 
"communication path. Of course, in the air, there's no real "
"physical pipe of a channel. So, by channel, we really mean a logical "
link. Okay? 
What actually happens is just energy propagating in the electromagnetic field 
"and being picked up by antenna. We don't have pipes, as if we are going to "
"join pipes but no actually don't. So, these are logical channels. "
"And we say that, there is a transceiver pair from the transmitter one to the "
"logical receiver one, and then from transmitter two to logical receiver two. "
"So, what happens is these two logical receivers are physically co-located at the "
"same spot. And then, what about interference? "
"When transmitter one talks, the energy propagates, okay? "
"And, part of the energy will be picked up by this logical receiver two. "
"This is a dotted line to represent an interference channel, and there's the "
"other interference channel. And we will use the following symbol, G "
sub ij to denote the channel loss on the corresponding direct or interference 
"channel. Now, somehow the community got stuck with "
the term channel gain even though these piece numbers between zero and one. 
"So, it should be called channel loss. Let's say, they're called channel gains. "
"Now, this is a little tricky. So, we'll go a little slow here, it says, "
G ij represents the channel gain from the transmitter of the logical transceiver 
"pair, j, to the receiver of logical transceiver pair i. "
"So we're going to use the terms user, transmitter receiver pair, or logical "
"transceiver pair interchangeably. For example, G11 is the channel from the "
"transmitter of logical pair one, to the receiver of logic pair one, say, well, "
"that's a good channel. Indeed, it is the direct channel for "
"desired communication, and so, it's G22. So, in general, Gii are the direct "
"channels. But when j is not equal to i, for example, "
"G21 that says, this is from the transmitter of pair one over here to the "
"receiver of pair two. And therefore this is, the channel gain of "
"an interference channel. G12 says, this is from the transmitter of "
"pair two to the receiver of pair one. And in general, G12 is not equal to G21 "
"necessarily. Now, ideally of course, we want Gii's to "
"be bigger than Gij's, where j is not equal to i. "
"And, indeed, with the help of those spreading codes, those 1s and -1s, we do "
"have, usually, a Gii that's bigger than Gij's. "
"However, there could be many j's not equal to i, okay? "
"There could be tens of them, and even though each one provides just a little bit "
"of interference to your transmission, they could add up, okay? "
"And that is the, cocktail party issue again. "
"So, how do we capture the notion of received signal quality? "
"If the quality is high, you will be able to talk more efficiently. "
"For example, you can talk faster, and the receiver can still understand what you are "
"talking about. But sometimes, in cocktail party, cuz it's "
"so noisy around, so much interference, you have to slow down your conversation, okay? "
"You have to talk slower, that is fewer bits per second, so that the receiver can "
hear you correctly. And the way we capture this ratio is 
"through the so-called SIR, Signal to Interference plus noise Ratio. "
"Now, what is the signal? I'm not talking about the signal power at "
"the transmitter side, I'm talking about the signal power at the receiver side. "
"So, that is the transmit power which we denote by P sub, let's say, i, P sub i. "
"Multiplied by the channel, that's the direct channel getting to the receiver of "
"pair i, that's the received power. Divided by, this is the ratio of the "
"interference collected at the receiver. That is, P sub j times Gij, okay? "
"From j-th transmitter, okay? To the same common i-th receiver. "
And there are many of such i's not equal to i. 
"Plus, at the i-th receiver, there's usually some noise turn n sub i. "
This is what we call the SIR associated with the i-th user. 
"For example, in our previous case we have a, just two users and therefore, SIR one "
"is simply P1 G11 over P2 G12 plus n1. And also, SIR2 is just P2 times G22 over "
"interference, which is P1 times G21 plus n2, okay? "
"But in general, you have more than one term here in the denominator. "
"So now, that we have the notation. Let's look at what kind of function this "
"SIR is. Sir for each transceiver pair i, okay? "
The received signal difference ratio for pair i is really a function of the entire 
"vector with this notation on top of power vector P, okay? "
"It's not just a function of your own power, But also function of others power. "
That is the mathematical representation of the very physical fact of interference in 
wireless communication. If there is no other users easy to 
"increase the SIR for user one, I'll just increase P1. "
"But, of course, there are other users. A larger P1 helps SIR1, but it will also "
"show up as a larger denominator for the other SIRs that would hurt the other SIRs, "
"okay? So, first observation is that SR is a "
"function of the entire vector P. Now second, what are the constants and "
what are your degrees of freedom? Because we're talking about transmit power 
"control, so obviously, the degree of freedom is the vector P. "
That's what we want to design and optimize over. 
We are given all the Gij's that is determined by the propagation environment 
"cuz there's indoors, there's outdoor, what kind of terrain is it. "
It is given by the location of the transceivers and that's not up to us to 
"optimize. And, we are given all these receiver "
"electronics and therefore, their noise. So, the G's and n's are given constants. "
The P's are what we'll be calling the optimization variables in transmit power 
"control. So now, our goal is to say, all different "
"transceiver peers index by i we'd like to, again, certain SIR achieved. "
"So, the question is, for a given set of G's and n's, can we find such a vector P? "
Is there such a vector P at all to achieve certain target SIR values? 
"And if there is more than one, which one shall we pick? "
"In the next module of the video lecture, we're going to see the answers to these "
questions in a distributed mechanism to co-ordinate interference in wireless 
cellular networks. And that mechanism is now in use in many 
wireless standards. 
""
Ten of us have been abducted by aliens because they view us 
as being representative of the human race. 
And what they're going to do is they're going to test us to 
see if the human race is worthy of joining the 
intergalactic council of planets. 
"And if we're not, they're going to kill us all and and "
"turn Earth into a mushroom farm, because "
that's their oil. 
"So they take us together in their spaceship and they say, "
"you ten represent all of humanity, and the fate of "
humanity rests in your hands. 
And we'll give you a test. And the test is tomorrow. 
"24 hours from right now, we're going to put you all in a "
"completely dark room, and line you all up "
one behind the other. 
So if this is one guy-- let me see if I can draw-- so if this 
is the guy in the front. 
He's looking a little worried. 
Someone described me as the Bob Ross of mathematics. 
So I'll attempt to do a little Bob Ross work right here. 
So this would be the first of us. 
"He has a business tie on, and whatever. "
He's facing in this direction. 
And then there's ten more of them. 
"So instead of redrawing them, let me just copy and paste it. "
We all look mysteriously similar to each other. 
That's the second one. 
And the third one. 
There's ten of us like this. 
I'll do one more. 
Oh that's good enough. 
"There's ten of us, and we're essentially lined up front to "
"back, so that this guy, all he sees is the back "
of this guy's head. 
And he can also see the back of this guy's head. 
"Maybe there's a slight incline, maybe the "
floor is like this. 
Let me see if I can draw it. 
"The floor is at a slight tilt, so one guy is "
standing right here. 
Another guy is standing right here. 
Another guy's standing right here. 
There's ten of us in a line. 
We're all facing in that direction. 
All this guy right here can see is the wall. 
This guy can see the two guys in front of him. 
This guy can see the one guy in front of him. 
There's ten of them. 
It goes all the way back to ten 
So what they tell us is we're going to 
line you up like this. 
"They even draw a nice diagram like this, because they want "
to give us a fair chance of preventing Earth from turning 
into a mushroom farm. 
"And they say, while the room is completely pitch dark, "
we're going to place a hat on each of your heads. 
And the hat will either be mauve-- so this 
would be a mauve hat. 
Or they'll be green. 
So they either get a mauve or a green hat on the 
back of your head. 
"And the hat will be designed in such a way, it "
won't have a big rim. 
So that you can't look up and see your hat. 
"This is alien technology, so it is completely impossible to "
see the hat on your own head. 
And the distribution of the hats will be random. 
It could be all green hats. 
"It could be all-- well, I'll say purple-- because I'm not "
quite sure how to pronounce mauve. 
"So it could be all purple hats, it could be half purple, "
half green. 
It could be nine green and one purple. 
They don't know. 
It could be any combination of hats. 
And what they're going to do-- and they tell us all of this-- 
is that they're going to start with the person in the back. 
"So this is the front wall, this is the floor. "
"This is the first guy right here, second guy, third guy, "
"fourth guy, fifth guy, sixth guy, seven, eight, nine. "
So there's the tenth guy. 
They're all faced in that direction. 
They're going to start with this guy right here. 
"And say, what color is the hat on your head? "
"And he'll answer, either purple or green. "
He can only say purple or green. 
I have to be exact here. 
He can only say purple or green. 
And he can say it as loud as he wants. 
"But he has to say it at an even tone, so that not more "
"information can be conveyed, other than the fact that he "
thinks his hat is purple or green. 
Although this guy is close enough that he can hear it. 
Everyone's going to hear what everyone's going to say. 
But there's no intonation. 
"And if you're right, if you say, my hat is purple and you "
"are wearing a purple hat, you will live. "
And the 600 million people that you 
represent will also live. 
And where they live will not be turned 
into a mushroom farm. 
"And if you're wrong, then they will immediately-- what is "
that Star Trek weapon? 
Displace you. 
And they'll also do it to all the people you represent. 
And turn all of their land into mushroom farms. So 
there's this huge incentive to try to get this right. 
"So they say, we're going to do this tomorrow. "
"And your goal, obviously, is to try to save as many lives "
as you can. 
"And so we're going to put you in a room, and you guys can "
"discuss this for the next 24 hours, to come up with a "
system so that when we put you in the dark room and we put 
the hats on each of your heads. 
I shouldn't be drawing brown hats. 
We'll put the hats on your head. 
And then turn on the lights. 
I forgot to tell you that. 
"They're going to put us in a dark room, you can't see "
"anything, we're all lined up. "
Then they're going to turn on the lights. 
"And so then they'll ask this guy, what color is "
the hat on your head? 
"He obviously can't look at his own head, but he'll see "
everyone else's hats. 
"And likewise this guy, he can't see his own hat, and he "
can't see the guy behind him. 
"But he'll hear what this guy says, and he can see all of "
the hats in front of him. 
"So they'll turn on the lights, and then after this guy-- if "
"he's right he lives, if he's wrong he'll be displaced. "
And then they'll go to the next guy. 
And then ask him. 
"If he's right he lives, and all the people "
he represents lives. 
If he's wrong he also will get displaced. 
And they'll keep going all the way up to the first guy. 
"So our goal to essentially save civilization, or at least "
"human civilization, is to come up with a system to save as "
many of us as possible. 
So that's the first take of the brain teaser. 
So if you want to kind of pause it right here. 
"And actually before you pause it, let me just clarify. "
All you can say is either purple or green. 
No intonations. 
"You can't say ""pur-puuul"" or ""purp-l"" to kind of convey any "
type of information. 
All you can say is purple or green. 
Or pronounce it in some weird way. 
And there's no weird trick where you can kind of look 
with the side of your eyes or anything like this. 
You have to do it completely based on what you hear and 
what you say. 
And if the aliens catch any hint of you 
guys trying to cheat. 
Or all of us. 
I'm one of us. 
"To cheat this, they'll just evaporate everything and turn "
everything into mushroom farms. 
So that's the problem statement. 
How do you save as many people as possible? 
"And if you want to pause now, feel free to do so. "
"And now I'll give you kind of a small hint, because this "
doesn't help you. 
It's easy to think of a lot of solutions that might save a 
couple of people. 
But there's actually a solution that will guarantee 
saving nine people. 
So that's the solution that you have to come up with. 
And for the rest of this video I'm just going to keep giving 
"hints, and then eventually give you the solution. "
So the goal is actually really to save nine people. 
And you can which nine people it's going to be. 
"And so once again, pause it if you don't want any more hints. "
It's going to be these nine people. 
These nine people are guaranteed to be saved. 
And this guy obviously is just going to be guessing. 
He is the first guy to be asked what color his hat is. 
He has no information. 
"He can see the people in front of him, but he has absolutely "
no information as to what color this hat is. 
So he just guesses. 
So there's a 50% chance that he's right. 
"Without any other information, we assume that there's a 50-50 "
chance that the hat on the top of your head is a 
purple or a green one. 
So your expected number of people you're going to save is 
nine and a half. 
With the system. 
So these people are guaranteed to be saved. 
"And so, there's a couple of things that are more "
probabilistic that don't quite get you there. 
That might come to mind immediately. 
"And once again, stop this video. "
Because it's fun to think of these yourself. 
"But this guy might just see, OK how many green hats are "
"there, and how many purple hats are there? "
"And then whichever there are more of, he might say, oh my "
hat is-- let's say there's six purple and three green in 
front of him-- he might say my hat is purple. 
"And he's either right or wrong, and "
he might get displaced. 
But at least he'll have conveyed that information to 
the rest of the group. 
"That hey, the majority of the hats are purple, so you're "
"better off guessing purple than green, and it'll save at "
least six of these people because 
they'll all guess purple. 
"And that's OK, and in this situation you're guaranteed to "
"save more than half of these nine people, so you're "
guaranteed to save at least five of these nine people. 
And then probablistically maybe you can get 
up to seven or eight. 
Then there's the other method. 
"Well, there's a ton of them. "
I don't go into them because I realize I don't 
have a lot of time. 
So here is the real deal solution. 
"So really pause it and wait and watch it tomorrow, unless "
you don't want the solution. 
"The guy in the back, what he does. "
So there are a bunch of people. 
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, "
"eight, nine, ten people. "
And they're all wearing hats. 
"And remember, we have 24 hours to come up with a system. "
So everyone has the system. 
And we don't know who's going to be in what order also. 
That's the other thing. 
But that actually doesn't help or hurt you much anyway. 
"So the guy in the back, what he does is he counts the "
number of green or purple hats. 
Right? 
This is the system we've come up with. 
And so this is true of whoever's in the back. 
"Whoever's in the back has to do this, right? "
So if he counts that the number of green-- let's say 
this is our system. 
He counts the green actually only. 
So count the green. 
And he determines that the number of 
green is an odd number. 
If he determines that the number of green that he sees 
"in front of him is an odd number, then he is "
going to say green. 
For the guess on the top of his head. 
"If the number of green is an even number, he's "
going to say purple. 
"And of course, he doesn't know what his hat color is, but at "
"least, well, one, he has a 50-50 "
chance of saving himself. 
"But now, what happens? "
"Now, by giving this information to the rest of the "
"group, by screaming green or purple. "
"If this guy screams, my hat is green! "
"Then this guy, who's the next guy in line, the next guy to "
"be quizzed, knows that the person behind him saw an odd "
number of green hats. 
Now this is interesting. 
"If he counts the number of green in front of him, and he "
"also sees an odd number of green hats, then that means "
that he was not one of the green hats that this guy saw. 
So he must be a purple hat. 
"So he'll just say, I have a purple hat. "
And he will live. 
Right? 
And then you'll go to this guy. 
And let's go the other situation. 
"Let's say that this guy, he screamed green. "
Which means that he saw an odd number of green 
hats in front of him. 
If this guy counts the green hats of the eight people in 
"front of him, and he says wow, there's only an even number of "
"green hats, he could say, wow I must have a green hat. "
And so then he'll say green. 
And then he'll be right. 
"Likewise, this guy-- let's say it's the first situation that "
"I said, this guy has a purple hat on. "
So this guy saw an odd number of green hats. 
He screamed green. 
"And so this guy, he also sees an odd number of green hats, "
because he's not one of the green hats. 
"So he says purple, he lives. "
"This guy all of a sudden, because this guy said purple. "
And he lived. 
"I mean, you didn't hear any buzzer. "
"Actually you know he's going to live, because "
the system will work. 
He knows that there must be an odd number of green hats from 
"him down forward, right? "
Because this guy didn't say green. 
So if he knows that there's an odd number of green hats from 
"him down forward, and if he sees an even number of green "
"hats, he knows that he must be one of the green hats, so "
he'll say green. 
"And in that situation, if this guy screamed green then that "
means that if this guy saw an odd number of green hats from 
"here on down, and one of these guys behind him, or every time "
"someone behind you says green after that, then the number of "
green hats that are odd or even in front of that person 
will change. 
And so they have to keep track of that in their minds to 
figure out if the hats in front of them are going to be 
green or purple. 
Actually let me give an example because that's 
probably the easiest way. 
"So there's one, two-- Actually let me just do it in a neutral "
color so I don't waste time. 
"So let's say the hats are green, purple, purple, green, "
"green, purple, green, green. "
How many is that? 
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. "
So you go to the first guy right here. 
And so he counts. 
"He says, OK, how many greens are there? "
"There's one, two, three, four, five. "
There are five greens. 
So the greens are odd. 
Which says that he is going to say green. 
That's the system we've come up with. 
"So when they go up to this guy, he says green. "
And he's wrong. 
So he actually gets eliminated. 
And maybe the aliens were willing to give us a pass on 
"the first guy, but let's say he gets eliminated. "
"But he said green, so then this guy on down knows that in "
front of that guy there was an odd number of green hats. 
"Now, this guy, he looks forward and he counts one, "
"two, three, four, five green hats. "
"So he also sees an odd number of green hats, so he knows "
"that he must not have a green hat, because if he had a green "
"hat, then it would turn the number of green hats that he "
saw into even. 
So he doesn't have a green hat. 
"He says, I have a purple hat. "
And he lives. 
"Now this guy, he counts the number of green "
hats in front of him. 
"One, two, three, four green hats. "
"He says, well gee, I only see an even number of green hats. "
"Up until this guy, he saw an odd number of green hats. "
I must be a green hat. 
So he says green. 
Check. 
Now this guy's turn. 
"So first of all, he knows how many green hats this guy saw. "
He knows that this guy saw exactly four green hats. 
"Because if this guy had seen five green hats, he would have "
said purple. 
So this guy knows that this guy saw four green hats. 
"But he sees only one, two, three green hats. "
Right? 
So he knows that he must be one of the green hats. 
So he screams green. 
So check. 
"So then this guy knows, wow there must be only three green "
hats from him on down. 
Because this guy must have seen three green hats. 
"If he saw four, he would have said purple. "
"So that guy uses that same logic to say OK, there must be "
three green hats from me on down. 
"I see three green hats, so I must not have one of them. "
I must be purple. 
And you just keep on going down all the way until 
everyone answers correctly. 
And you save at least nine people. 
And the bulk of humanity. 
"And if you gave a pass on the first guy, "
you save all of humanity. 
"Anyway, I hope you found that one enjoyable. "
This is one of my favorite brain teasers. 
And I apologize because I realize when I was trying to 
"explain it without the example, it might have gotten "
a little confusing. 
But hopefully this example explains things 
a little bit better. 
Although it might be confusing to see green and purple 
written in blue. 
See you in the next video. 
""
""
"There's a new reality television program, and it's "
called the Blue-- I should probably write it in blue-- 
but it's called the Blue Forehead Room. 
""
And what they do in this reality television program-- 
"and you'll have to bear with me, because the show probably "
wouldn't be that interesting to watch-- but it's 
interesting to predict what happens. 
"What they do is, they take a room. "
They'll call it the blue forehead room. 
"And let's see, that's kind of a top view of the room. "
And let's say there's a door here. 
None of this is relevant to the actual problem. 
"This is the door, right there. "
And what they do is they get 100 perfect logicians to sit 
"in this room, in a circle. "
So they're all sitting in a circle in this room. 
"Now, before the game even starts, before they even enter "
"the room the first time, the logicians are told two things. "
"They're told, One: that at least one of you has your "
forehead painted blue. 
""
At least one of you has your forehead-- And they all get 
"their foreheads painted, so that obviously if you're the "
only guy who has your forehead painted. 
But you just don't know what color it is. 
So all of them have different color foreheads. 
"Or, we don't know. "
"But all they're told is, obviously I've "
painted your forehead. 
At least one of the people in the room that you will enter 
will have their forehead painted blue. 
And then they're also told that as soon as you deduce 
"that your forehead is blue, you need to leave the room. "
""
And what's going to happen is-- and it's very important 
that I set this up properly. 
They're all outside of the room. 
No-one's inside the room. 
And let's say they're blindfolded. 
"And while they're blindfolded, they essentially have the "
thing painted onto their forehead. 
So they can't see the paintbrush or anything. 
So they really don't know what's on their forehead. 
"And then after that, they all enter the room. "
"And they all sit in a circle like this, so that they can "
all look at each other. 
"And let's say when they enter, the lights are off. "
"So the lights are off, and then the protocol is that the "
"lights will be turned on, and then they can all look around "
at each other. 
There's no reflective surfaces. 
They can't look into each other's eyes and try to see 
the reflection. 
No tricks like that. 
There are no mirrors in this room. 
Nothing like that. 
All they can do is look at each other. 
"So, just as an example, let's say that "
this is me right here. 
"As soon as the lights get turned on the first time, I'll "
be able to look at all the other people in the room. 
"And I could see, it'll be pretty obvious to me if anyone "
has a blue forehead. 
"Maybe that guy has one, that guy doesn't. "
"I don't know, right? "
And I can see them. 
I can't see my own forehead. 
"And what happens is, then they will turn off the lights, and "
the way they're going to do it is you have to leave the room 
after you have realized that you have a blue forehead. 
"So for example, let's say I enter into the room, and "
because I'm a perfect logician I see things that allow me to 
perfectly deduce that I have a blue forehead. 
Then what they're going to do is they're going to turn off 
the lights again. 
"And then, if I know that I have a blue forehead while the "
"lights are turned off, I would leave the room. "
"And then when they turn the lights back on, I'd be gone. "
So there would be no Sal here. 
"So let's say there were 100 before, then there would be 99 "
guys sitting in the room. 
Right? 
"As soon as I realize I have a blue forehead, when the lights "
"get turned off, I leave. And just remember these are "
perfect logicians. 
So everyone in the room. 
"And not only are they all perfect logicians, but they "
all know that everyone else is a perfect logician. 
"So, everyone is also told, and this is true, everyone is a "
perfect logician. 
Which means they have infallible powers of logic. 
""
"So my question to you-- Just remember, I have each of these "
perfect logicians. 
"We set them up outside of the room, paint their foreheads. "
They're blindfolded. 
They have no clue. 
"Then we have all of them walk into a dark room, sit in a "
circle like this. 
"And then what we tell them is, as soon as you realize that "
"you have a blue forehead, as soon as you have a blue "
"forehead, you have to leave the room. "
"Now my question to you is, let's say that we've actually "
painted everybody's forehead blue. 
What happens? 
"So remember, this is what we've told each of the people. "
Right? 
"As soon as you realize your forehead is blue, "
you leave the room. 
"And now I've just asked you, the producers like to really "
play with these logicians. 
They've actually painted everybody's forehead blue. 
"So when everyone goes in the room the first time, what's "
going to happen? 
Let's say I'm one of the logicians. 
This is me right here. 
"As soon as I open my eyes, I'm going to see 99 other fellow "
logicians with blue foreheads. 
"And then, maybe I can somehow deduce something about my own. "
I don't think you can. 
And the lights will go off. 
And then if I haven't deduced anything about my own blueness 
"of my forehead, then they'll turn the lights back on. "
And then maybe some other guy will have left. 
I don't know. 
Or maybe not. 
And then I'll see the same 99 guys again. 
And that'll just keep occurring 
until something happens. 
And my question to you is what happens? 
When? 
And why? 
""
I'm thinking whether I should give you a hint right now. 
Well let me tell it to you this way. 
That's the problem. 
You should be able to solve it. 
"And just so you know where this came from, if I remember "
correctly I think this was on a computer science 
exam I had at MIT. 
"So just so you know, this isn't just for fun. "
""
I don't want to go into all of the applications that this 
"type of problem can apply to, because that by itself would "
be a bit of a hint. 
"So if you don't want a hint, turn off the video "
now or pause it. 
"If you do want a hint, I'm about to give it to you. "
So my hint is-- and remember turn this off if you don't 
want to hint-- but the hint is what happens when there are 
less than 100 people. 
So I gave the situation where we have 100 logicians. 
But this problem is actually a lot easier if you try it with 
a smaller number. 
Anyway I'll see you in the solution video. 
""
""
So say you just moved from England to the US 
and you've got your old school supplies from England 
and your new school supplies from the US 
and it's your first day of school and you get to class 
and find that your new American paper doesn't fit in your 
old English binder. 
"The paper is too wide, and hangs out. "
So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper. 
And to keep yourself amused during your math class 
you start playing with them. 
"And by you, I mean "
Arthur H. Stone in 1939. 
"Anyway, there's lots of cool things "
you do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into Shapes 
and more shapes. 
Maybe spiral it around snugly like this. 
Maybe make it into a square. 
Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with 
a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts. 
"In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip, "
and the your hexagon is pretty stable. 
"and you're like. ""I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting, "
"but I guess it has symmetry or something."" "
Maybe you could kinda fold it 
so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up. 
"That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles, "
"which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are, "
"you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little but during your class. "
"And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry, "
"you decide to try this three-way fold the other way, "
"with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down "
when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up 
"What, you close it back up and undo it. "
"Everything seems the same as before, "
the center is not open-uppable. 
"But when you fold it that way again, "
"it, like, flips inside-out. Weird. "
"This time, instead of going backwards, "
you try doing it again and again and again and again. 
"And you want to make one that's a little less messy, "
so you try with another strip and tape it nicely 
into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide 
"that it would be cool to colour the sides, "
so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow. 
Now you can flip from yellow side to white side. 
"Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side "
Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go? 
"So you go back and this time you colour the white side green, "
and find that your piece of paper has three sides. 
"Yellow, white and green. "
Now this thing is definitely cool. 
"Therefore, you need to name it. "
And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it 
"and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is. "
"That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking "
about hexaflexagons. 
"And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class "
you pull out your paper strips. 
You had made this sort of spirally folded paper 
"that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper, "
and you decide to take that 
and use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon. 
"Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier "
with the extra paper. 
"And you color the three sides and are like, "
"orange, yellow, pink. "
And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class. 
"Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink. "
"Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second. "
"Okay, so you colour that one green. "
"And now it;s orange, yellow, green, Orange, yellow, green. "
Who knows where the pink side went? 
"Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink. "
"Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue. "
"Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh. "
"With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way, "
flappy way up. 
But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways. 
"Yes, one goes from pink to blue, "
"but the other, from pink to orange. "
"And now, one way goes from orange to yellow, "
but the other way goes from orange to neon yellow. 
During lunch you want to show this off 
"to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman. "
"You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon, "
which you call the trihexaflexagon. 
"and he's like, whoa! "
and wants to learn how to make one. 
"and you are like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip, "
"fold it into equilateral traingles, "
"and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around "
into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric. 
"The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not, "
then you're doing it wrong. 
And then you just tape the first triangle to the last 
"along the edge, and you're good. "
But Tuckerman doesn't have tape. 
"After all, it was invented only 10 years ago. "
"So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine, "
and then glues the first to the last. 
Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a 
flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it 
"flat and traingly, and then opening from the centre. "
You decide to start a flexagon committee together 
"to explore the mysteries of flexagotion, "
But that will have to wait until next time.

"Ladies and Gentleman, please join me in welcoming the commencement speaker for "
"our 99th commencement exercises, Salman Khan. [APPLAUSE] "
"It's really an honor, a surreal honor, to be here. What I hope to do, 'cause, to a large degree, I -- "
"maybe, 35 might seem a lot older, but from my perspective, I don't feel a lot older "
than many of y'all in the audience. I kind of feel like a bit of an older brother to you. 
"What I want to do is just share some thoughts, ideas, guiding principles that I have in my own adventure. "
They're a work in progress. Take them with a grain of salt. 
"Hopefully, they'll help you in some way as you go on -- as you are about to embark on your own adventures. "
In a few minutes you are going to get a diploma. And it's a powerful thing. 
"Obviously, things brought you to Rice -- your intelligence, your creativity, your hard work. "
"But what that diploma is going to be is validation, a very powerful validation, "
"from one of the world's truly great universities. And when you have that, really neat things "
are going to start happening in your life. You're going to go places. 
You're going to get the interview. Your resumé is going to go to the top of the stack. 
People are going to give you responsibility. They're going to give you the benefit of the doubt. 
The first thing I really want to kind of think together about is how you can leverage that validation that you're 
"about to get to kind of increase the positivity in the world, the net happiness in the world, to help -- "
hopefully empower others. And I personally believe that it'll probably come back to you. 
"And I say this from the point of view of someone who's been directly empowered by Rice graduates, "
"frankly, in a way that, frankly, all of what you just heard might not have happened had a few "
Rice graduates not stepped out of the woodwork. 
in 2009 -- and you heard a little bit of the narrative of the Khan Academy -- it started from my cousins 
"-- 2009, tens of thousands of people started using it. It was pretty obvious that most of them were not my cousins. "
I was fairly kind of intoxicated by what was happening. I was getting thank you letters from around the world. 
"I sat down with my wife, and we had a little bit of savings. "
"In the introduction, it said I was the hedge-fund manager. I want to clarify. I was the hedge fund analyst. "
It's two different economic strata. But it was a good career. I was doing well. 
"And there was the potential of, one day, becoming the manager. "
"But I, frankly, had trouble focusing on my day job. And so, I sat down with my wife. And we had a little bit of savings. "
"And I said, ""Hey, someone should -- It's a not for profit. "
There's a potential here to do civilization-scale education. We can educate people for all of time. 
"There's almost an infinite social return on investment here. Surely, someone's going to realize that this is worth funding. "
And I kind of took that fairly naive point of view and quit my job and started working full time on the Khan Academy. 
"And like a lot of these stories happen, nine months into it, I had a lot of meetings and nothing quite had happened. "
"Frankly, when you hear a bio and you're on these lists, you think ""Oh, it must have just been this very smooth ride."" "
"But, nine months into it, I actually hit something of a low point. "
We just had our first -- I was 32 years old. Our son had just been born. 
"We had dug about thirty or forty thousand dollars into our savings, which was really for "
a down payment for a house we hadn't bought yet. 
"And, like a lot of you guys, I had been this person -- "
"good grades my whole life, kind of a fast track career and all that. "
"And all of a sudden I had done something that was a risk. And I knew that people kind of said, ""Well, you know, "
"what's going on? Has Sal flaked out?"" "
"I started becoming a little bit paranoid -- (""Have I failed my family?) -- "
"that we were on track to have a comfortable life and now, maybe it's all gone."" "
"Frankly, the only thing that kept me going was small acts of validation -- "
"letters from people around the world saying, ""Hey, this really helped. "
"I got an 'A' on my algebra exam."" Or, ""This is the reason I was able to go back to college,"" "
or whatever else. 
"But then all of a sudden, really, when I was almost at the lowest point, and I was frankly about to give up, "
"I got the biggest act of validation -- or one in a series, really. "
"I had a little link on the web site where people were donating five [or] ten dollars, and then "
"all of a sudden a ten thousand dollar donation comes in. And it was from someone named Ann Doerr, "
who I later learned is Rice class of 1975. 
"And I immediately emailed her back, I was like, ""Well, thank you very much. This is the largest donation "
"that the Khan Academy has ever received. If we were a physical school, you would "
"now have a building named after you."" "
"(Which I think is somewhat less than what it goes for over here. I don't know what the, what the a -- ) "
But she said -- She was in Northern California. 
"And she said, ""Well, we should have lunch. I want to learn more about what you're doing."" "
And we had lunch at an Indian buffet restaurant in downtown Palo Alto. 
"And she says, ""What's your vision here?"" "
"I said, ""Well, I want to keep making videos for the rest of my life. "
We can have other faculty members. We can translate it into the world's languages. 
"We can have interactive software, feedback. We can have ways for us to connect students in "
"the world so that they can help each other. Really, a world class education for "
"anyone anywhere -- for free."" "
"And she says ""Well, you know, it's a very grand ambition. But I've seen what you've already done."" "
(I had about 900 videos at that point.) 
"""And I really think there's a potential here. But I have a question: "
"'How are you supporting yourself?'"" "
"And in kind of as proud a way as possible, I said, ""I'm not."" "
And she kind of nodded; and we went on our way. She got back on her bicycle. 
I got in my car. I went home. 
"And right when I was going into the driveway, already excited, not expecting much more -- "
I'd had a hundred meetings like that. And not much had come of it. 
She had already proved to be the biggest supporter of the Khan Academy. 
"Right when I'm coming into my driveway, I get a text message from Ann. "
"And it reads, ""You really need to be supporting yourself, I've just wired you a hundred thousand dollars."" "
So it was a good day. (And I almost crashed into the garage.) 
"And I say that -- Obviously, the money was a big deal -- "
based on the situation I was in and the family was in -- But the real power of what Ann did was that act of 
empowerment -- that act of validation. That act that [said] she really believed in what I was doing. 
"And I know, sometimes when I tell this story, in the back of people's mind, [they] say, "
"""Well you know, she was in a position to do that. "
"I'm not in a position to give someone a hundred thousand dollars."" "
"But, one, I want to highlight that I had meetings with probably fifty other folks "
who were in even a better position to do it. 
But it was really -- they were waiting for something else to happen. 
"They were saying, ""Well this guy's operating out of a closet. "
"I don't know what to make of it. It sounds like a good idea [but] -- ."" "
"And because of that kind of stalling, the idea might have [come] to nothing. "
It might have not existed. And it really took a special type of person to step out there. 
"And the other thing I want to point out is, yes, if you are in a position [to do] what Ann did, "
"that's unbelievable, and that's an unbelievable power to have in your life. "
"But, I personally believe, and now, especially, now that I'm getting [into] more of a position to – "
not to do what Ann did but to -- empower other people -- . 
I want to highlight that this is something that you can do in your own way tonight. 
You can validate others -- empower others -- increase the net happiness -- the positivity in the world. 
"I mean, it can be as simple as: your family's going to have dinner tonight. "
And you go to a restaurant tonight and you see someone do something great. 
"And too often, we kind of just sit back and say, ""Oh, that was good, that was good service."" "
Maybe you give an extra tip. 
"You're at work or you see a colleague who goes above and beyond, and you say, "
"""Oh, that was pretty good -- they did a nice thing."" "
"And what I hope -- and this is something that I tell myself all the time is, "
"""Don't just sit by and observe it. Recognize it! "
"When you see someone do something great, tell them about it. "
"Tell their bosses about it. Tell their family about it."" "
"And when you do that, all sorts of neat, exciting things are going to start percolating into the universe. "
"Obviously, you are going to make that person's day. You're going to make their year. "
You might make their career. I've seen it happen before. 
"You probably, in some way, will make their life. "
"Even more, they're going to start doing that ultra-positive thing more. "
"People around them are going to see the recognition they got for it, "
And they are going to start emulating it. 
And even though it wasn't your intent -- you just wanted to highlight 
something good that's happening in the world -- people will recognize that you are 
"a source of positivity. And when you are a source of positivity, "
people will just naturally gravitate to you. 
"The other, the second idea I want to share with you -- (And once again, all of these are works in progress.) "
is the idea of kind of being a life-long learner. 
Something I want to stress as much as possible Given the phase that you're about to enter -- 
"You know, the next ten years are your chance to ask the naive questions "
that you will later learn are really the profound questions 
The ones that are really going to be the game changers -- 
Your chance to really invest in yourself -- 
"One thing that I have kind of a unique vantage point at the Khan Acadamy, "
"is that we see all of these lifelong learners, and how much it's changing their own views on life "
"And, you know, early on, in 2008, I had a -- when the financial crisis hit -- I started making videos "
"it was my background -- I started making videos on the Federal Reserve, "
"and credit default swaps, and mortgage-backed securities. And I got a letter from a -- I got all sorts of, you know -- "
"""This was really helpful. I understand what's happening in the news."" "
But I got one particularly powerful letter. 
It was a gentleman who worked at – I will say -- an unnamed investment bank. 
"And he says, ""Thank you for that video on mortgage- backed securities. I now know what I do for a living."" "
[LAUGHTER] 
"Which is, I guess, that's more of a scary story than a good one. "
But it goes to the extreme. 
It's not just something that's going to affect you in a practical way -- forward your career. 
Probably --- We get all sorts of amazing letters and testimonials from people around the world. 
"Still, the one that resonates in my brain the most -- "
And it really is this testament to lifelong learning. And it really is a testament that it goes beyond the practical. 
It goes beyond what you might make use of. 
"I got a letter, also in 2008, a terminal cancer patient -- she had two months to live. "
"And she said -- and it blew my mind – ""I have -- I've got two months."" "
And she said it in a shockingly positive tone. 
"And she said, ""But my life's dream was to learn calculus, and Khan Academy "
"has given [me] that, and I look forward to spending the last two months of my life learning it. "
"And when I saw that, it changed my own perspective It made me excited to be a learner for as "
long as I have the privilege of being around. 
"The last idea I want to share with you is really just kind of ""keep things in perspective."" "
"I know we all say it. But, it really – you just have to keep reinforcing it. "
Everyone in this audience -- knock on wood -- you're going to do just fine. 
You're going to have your four-bedroom house You're going to have your car with the power windows. 
"You'll be able to go to Sea World whenever you want to. But along that way, there are going to be ups and downs. "
"And actually, those ups and downs tend to happen a lot when you go to transition points. "
"When you are entering the work force, you're entering some type of new phase in your life. "
And you just always have to keep [focused] on the long-term game -- the end game. And I'll tell you myself -- 
I've gone through some fairly dramatic ones right when I was out [of] the gate. When I was -- 
This is 1998. I had just graduated. 
I was a few months older than most of y'all. 
And some computer magazine had seen something I had done. And they wrote this neat profile about me. 
"They called it ""Future So Bright."" And I saw that magazine, and I was very proud of it. "
"I said, ""Look, I'm set. I have this career ahead of me. I'm already profiled in a magazine."" "
"And frankly, I got kind of into myself. And that's OK. You can enjoy your successes. "
"But I really didn't have any perspective. And frankly, it was a dangerous thing to happen. "
And to really put things in perspective -- and I'm happy it did happen -- 
Two months later I had kind of switched jobs -- higher salary -- I thought I was on the fast track. 
And I had a new boss. 
"And on the first three days of work, he spent an hour just completely castigating me— "
Essentially telling me that I was not worth his time. 
"That I was incompetent, as far as he was concerned. And so you can imagine, "
[here I'd had] success my whole life -- fancy degrees from fancy universities -- 
"Two months ago, I was profiled in a magazine. And then now, all of a sudden, "
"not even twenty-three years old, I was back in a hotel room, in the middle of nowhere -- crying; "
"not knowing what I was going to do with my life -- convinced that it was all the end of everything, that all -- "
"that everthing was for naught. And so, you get through them. "
"You wake up in the morning. Things look a little bit better A week later, things look a little better. "
You start circulating your resumé around. I did find another job two months later. 
And it's OK. And the one thing I want to stress – 
(Because I've gone through ups and downs; and you only have one perspective for your own life.) 
"-- but I suspect many of you all are going to have higher ups than I've had, and many of "
you all are going to have lower downs. 
And I worry about that sometimes. 
"The ones of you who have higher ups, just keep them in perspective. And it's inevitable -- "
Some of you are going to race ahead and be so successful that none of us can imagine it right now. 
But keep them in perspective. Enjoy the successes. 
"But when your ego starts feeling a little bit large, keep in mind the sun will supernova one day, "
the galaxies will collide. 
We are just these small little mammals on this small planet. 
"There's a hundred, two-hundred million stars in the galaxy -- in just our galaxy alone. "
And just have peace in the little success[es]. And when you have a hard time -- 
and you will -- those of you who will go through painful periods. 
You might stumble and start your first few times out [of] the gate. 
Also keep in perspective that those stresses – put them in perspective of the universe – they are small. 
"They are going to be things that you’ll be able to laugh about, talk about, "
"ten, fifteen years from now – or hopefully ten, fifteen days from now. "
"And so to bring it all together, I want to give you a little thought experiment "
"that I actually use for myself all the time when I am faced with a tough decision, "
"or I want to think about, ""How do I approach my life?"" And so, imagine yourself 50 years in the future. "
You're in your early seventies. You're hanging out at home. 
You've just watched the state of the union hologram by President Bieber. 
"And right after that, you start reflecting on your life. "
And you first think about all of the successes you've had. 
You had a very good career – you were able to provide for your family – 
"you had amazing friendships -- And I'll tell you, (right?) "
"I can guarantee you, 50 years from now, you will keep reflecting "
about the friendships that you made here. 
You will keep thinking about this campus. And you'll reflect on them. You'll smile about it. 
"You'll think about your children, you'll think about the bonds you've made – "
the contributions you've made to the world. 
"But, you'll also think about things you'll wish you had done just a little bit better. "
"Maybe. Call them “regrets,” if you want. "
We'll all have them. I have a sense of what those regrets might be. 
"They'll be, ""Well, I did alright; but I wish that I had spent more time with my children. "
I wish that I told my spouse that I loved them more frequently. 
"I wish that I spread more positivity, I empowered more people, "
I validated more people. I smiled more often; 
I laughed more often. 
I wish that I had a chance to spend more time and hug and tell my parents 
how much I love them before they passed. 
"And right when you start having those regrets, a genie pops up and says, ""You seem like a good person. "
"You’ve done a lot in your life. But I've been eaves dropping on your regrets, "
and they seem like valid ones. 
"So I'm going to give you a second chance."" And you say, ""Well, sure."" "
"And so the genie snaps his fingers, and brings you back right over here -- "
"brings you back to Rice University, May 2012 "
"And says, ""This is your second chance. You can do all of the successes "
that you had in your first pass. But this is your chance to optimize. 
"This is your chance to laugh a little bit more, your chance to spread a little bit more positivity, "
"to spread a little bit more positivity, a chance to really tell the people who matter to you "
"just how much you love them, before, frankly, it's too late. "
And so here I am - truly honored and humbled to be here – 
just completely excited by what you all are going to do in your second pass. 
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]

Today's lecture is what have we learned in entrepreneurship for the last 40 years. 
One of the interesting questions is why are you here? 
I hope you're here to find out what does it take to go from an idea to a business. 
"For the last 20 years if you wanted to know how to go from an idea to a business, "
"the answer from educators and investors are simply, ""Well, go research and then write "
"a business plan and you'll know everything possible to actually start and run your business."" "
We now know that advice was simply wrong--not kind of wrong but very wrong. 
We now today know something we didn't know before. 
"We now know the right way to build startups and so this class is about that right way, "
"but before we get started, let's see how we took the wrong path "
and then see what we now know worse. 
""
Welcome back. 
Now that we hopefully have a little bit of an intuition of 
"what a limit is, or finding the limit of a function is, "
let's do some problems. 
Some of these you might actually see on your exams or 
when you're actually trying to solve a general limit problem. 
"So let's say what is the limit-- once again, my "
pen is not working. 
What is the limit as x approaches-- let's 
say negative 1. 
"And let me see, what's a good-- let's say my expression is-- "
I'll put it in parentheses so it's cleaner. 
It's 2x plus 2 over x plus 1. 
So the first thing I would always try to do is just say 
what happens if I just stick x straight into this expression? 
What happens? 
"Well, what's 2x plus 2 when x is equal to negative 1? "
2 times negative 1. 
2 times negative 1 plus 2 over negative 1 plus 1. 
"Well, the numerator is negative 2 plus 2-- that equals 0-- "
over-- what's the denominator? 
Negative 1 plus 1. 
Over 0. 
And do we know what 0 over 0 is? 
"Well, no. "
"It's undefined, right? "
"So here's a case, just like what we saw in that first "
"video, where the limit actually can't equal what the expression "
equals when you substitute x for the number you're trying to 
find the limit of because you get an undefined answer. 
"So let's see if, using the limit, we can come up "
with a better answer for what it's approaching. 
"Well, since we're just starting with these limit problems, "
let me draw a graph. 
And I think this is going to give you the intuition 
for what we're doing. 
It'll probably give you the answer. 
But then I'll show you how to solve this analytically. 
"So if I draw a graph, these are the axes. "
"Actually, I'll do the graphical and the analytical "
at the same time. 
So I want to rewrite this expression in a way that 
maybe I can simplify it. 
So 2x plus 2. 
Isn't that the same thing as 2 times x plus 1? 
""
"2 times x plus 1, right? "
"2x plus 2 is the same thing as 2 times x plus one, and then "
all of that is over x plus 1. 
So as long as this expression and this expression don't equal 
"0, it actually turns out that this function-- let's say "
"this is f of x, right? "
This function. 
"Well, for every value other than x is equal to negative "
"1, you could actually cancel this and this out. "
"And so really, we see that f of x is equal to-- I need to find "
a better tool-- f of x is equal to 2 when x does not 
equal negative 1. 
"And we saw when x is equal to negative 1, it's undefined. "
So undefined when equals negative 1. 
So how would we graph that? 
We showed that f of x is equal to 2 when x does not equal 
negative 1 and f of x is undefined when x 
equals negative 1. 
"And once again, all I did is kind of rewrite this exact "
"same function, right? "
I showed that I could simplify and I could divide the 
numerator and denominator by x plus 1 as long as x does not 
"equal negative 1, and that otherwise, it's undefined. "
So let me graph this. 
I'm going to get a different color. 
Maybe I'll go with red. 
So this is 2. 
So we see that x is-- and let me say this is negative 1. 
""
"So for every other value other than negative 1, the value of "
"this, of f of x, is equal to 2. "
"This is 1, this is 2, this is 3, and so on. "
"At negative 1, the graph is undefined. "
So there's a hole there. 
And then we keep going to the left-hand side. 
"So if we're going to do the limit, we can just visually "
"say, well, as x-- let me do another color now. "
"As x comes from the left-hand side, what does f of x equal? "
"Well, f of x is 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. f of x is equal to 2 "
"until we get to exactly negative 1, right? "
"And similarly, when we go from the other hand, it's "
the exact same thing. 
"f of x is 2, 2, 2 until we get to negative 1. "
"So you'll see, and I'll make sure you see it visually here, "
that the limit as approaches negative 1 of 2x plus 2 over 
"x plus 1, it equals 2. "
Let me draw a line here so you don't get messed 
up with all of it. 
"And I'm not formally, I guess, proving here that the limit is "
"2, but I'm showing you kind of an analytical way, and this is "
"actually how it tends to be done in algebra class, is that "
"you tend to simplify the expression so that you say, oh, "
"if there wasn't a hole here, what would the f of "
"x equal, right? "
And then you'd just evaluate it at that point. 
"I think this might give you a little intuition, but this "
isn't a formal solution. 
"But unless you're asked to, you tend not to be asked "
for a formal solution. 
"You actually just tend to ask what the limit is, and this is "
the way you could solve it. 
"And actually another way that you could-- I mean, I often "
used to check my answers when I used to do it is you could take 
a calculator and try in-- what happens when: what is f 
"of minus 1.001, right? "
"And you can also try what is f of negative 0.999, right? "
"Because what you want to do is you want to say, well, what "
does the function equal when I get really close to negative 1? 
And then you could keep going closer and closer to negative 
"1 and see what the function approaches, and in this "
"case, you'll see that it approaches 2. "
So let's do another problem. 
""
"Well, let's say, what is the limit as x approaches "
0 of 1 over x? 
I think here it might be useful to draw this graph because 
"it'll give you a visual reason, a visual represent-- actually, "
let's do it both ways. 
Let's say-- let's do it the picking-numbers method because 
I think that'll give you an intuition and maybe it'll 
help us draw the graph. 
So let's say that this is f of x. 
f of x-- you can tell my presentation is very 
unplanned-- f of x is equal to 1 over x. 
And we want to find the limit as x approaches 0. 
"So what is f of-- actually, let's make a table. "
f of x. 
""
"So clearly when x is equal to 0, we don't know. "
It's undefined. 
1 over 0 is undefined. 
""
But what happens when x equals minus 0.01? 
"Well, with minus 0.01, 1 over minus 0.01, that is equal "
"to negative 100, right? "
"What happens when x is equal to minus 0.001, right? "
So we're getting closer and closer to 0 from 
the negative direction. 
"Well, here it equals-- make sure my pen is "
"working, color right. "
Something's wrong with my tool. 
Now my computer's breaking down. 
Let's see what's going on. 
""
I think my computer just froze. 
"Well, I'm going to try to solve this, and in the very next "
"video, I'm going to continue on with this problem. "
So I'll actually see you in the next presentation while I 
"figure out why my pen isn't working, and then we'll "
continue with this problem. 
See you very soon. 
""
Let's get started with some problems. 
Let's see. 
First problem: what is fifteen percent of forty? 
The way I do percent problems is I just convert the 
percentage to a decimal and then I multiply it times the 
number that I'm trying to get the percentage of. 
So 15% as a decimal is 0.15. 
You learned that from the percent to decimal conversion 
"video, hopefully. "
And we just multiply this times forty. 
So let's say 40 times 0.15. 
five times zero is zero. 
five times four is twenty. 
Put a zero there. 
And then one times zero is zero. 
one times four is four. 
And you get six zero zero. 
Then you count the decimal spots. 
"one, two. "
"No decimals up there, so you go one, two and you "
put the decimal there. 
"So 15% of 40 is equal to 0.15 times 40, which equals 6.00. "
"Well, that's just the same thing as six. "
Let's do another problem. 
"Hopefully, that didn't confuse you too much. "
And I'm going to try to confuse you this time just 
in case you weren't properly confused the last time. 
What is 0.2% of-- let me think of a number-- of 7. 
So a lot of people's inclinations would just 
"say, oh, 0.2%, that's the same thing as 0.2. "
And if that was your inclination you would be wrong. 
"Because remember, this isn't 0.2. "
This is 0.2%. 
So there's two ways of thinking about this. 
"You could say that this is 0.2/100, which is, if you "
"multiply the numerator and denominator by ten, is the "
same thing as two / one thousand. 
Or you can just do the technique where you 
move the decimal space over two to the left. 
"In which case, if you're starting with 0.2 and you "
"move the decimal space two to the left, you go bam. "
Whoops! 
"Bam, bam. "
That's where the decimal goes. 
So it's 0.002. 
This is key. 
0.2% is the same thing as 0.002. 
This can always trip you up and I've made this careless mistake 
"all the time, so don't feel bad if you ever do it. "
But just always pay careful attention if you see a 
decimal and a percentage at the same time. 
So now that we've figured out how to write this percentage 
as a decimal we just have to multiply it times the number 
that we want to take the percentage of. 
So we say 0.002 times 7. 
"Well, this is pretty straightforward. "
seven times two is fourteen. 
And how many total numbers do we have or how many total 
digits do we have behind the decimal point? 
Let's see. 
"It's one, two, three. "
"So we need one, two, three digits behind the decimal point. "
So 0.2% of 7 is equal to 0.014. 
"And you're probably thinking, boy, that's a really, "
really small number. 
"And it makes sense because 0.2%, if you want to "
"think about it, that's smaller than even one percent. "
So that's even smaller than one / one hundred. 
"And actually, if you think about it, 0.2% is 1/500. "
"And if you do the math, one / five hundred of seven will turn "
out to be this number. 
And that's an important thing to do. 
It's always good to do a reality check because when 
"you're doing these decimal and these percent problems, it's "
very easy to kind of lose a factor of ten here or there. 
Or gain a factor of ten. 
So always do a reality check to see if your answer makes sense. 
So now I'm going to confuse you even further. 
What if I were to ask you four is twenty percent of what number? 
"So a lot of people's reflex might just be, "
"oh, let me take twenty percent. "
It becomes 0.20. 
And multiply it times four. 
"And in that case, again, you may be wrong. "
Because think about it. 
I'm not saying what is twenty percent of four? 
I'm saying that twenty percent of some number is four. 
So now we're going to be doing a little bit of algebra. 
I bet you didn't expect that in the percent module. 
So let x equal the number. 
And this problem says that twenty percent of x is equal to four. 
I think now it's in a form that you might recognize. 
So how do we write twenty percent as a decimal? 
"Well, that's just 0.20 or 0.2. "
And we just multiply it by x to get four. 
"So 20%, that's the same thing as 0.2. "
"It's the same thing as 0.20, but that last trailing "
zero doesn't mean much. 
0.2 times x is equal to 4. 
And now we have a level one linear equation. 
I bet you didn't expect to see that. 
So what do we do? 
Well there's two ways to view it. 
You can just divide both sides of this equation 
by the coefficient on x. 
So if you divide 0.2 here and you divide by 0.2 here. 
So you get x is equal to 4 divided by 0.2. 
So let's figure out what 4 divided by 0.2 is. 
I hope I have enough space. 
0.2 goes into 4-- I'm going to put a decimal point here. 
"And the way we do these problems, we move the "
decimal point here one over to the right. 
So we just get a two and then we can move the decimal point 
here one over to the right. 
So this 0.2 goes into 4 the same number of times 
that two goes into forty. 
And this is easy. 
two goes into forty how many times? 
"Well, two goes into four two times and then two goes "
"into zero, zero times. "
You could've done that in your head. 
two into forty is twenty times. 
So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20. 
So the answer is four is twenty percent of twenty. 
And does that make sense? 
"Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it. "
twenty percent is exactly one / five. 
And four times five is twenty. 
That makes sense. 
If you're still not sure we can check the problem. 
Let's take twenty percent of twenty. 
So 20% of 20 is equal to 0.2 times 20. 
And if you do the math that also will equal four. 
So you made sure you got the right answer. 
Let's do another one like that. 
I'm picking numbers randomly. 
Let's say three is nine percent of what? 
"Once again, let's let x equal the number that three is nine percent of. "
You didn't have to write all that. 
"Well, in that case we know that 0.09x-- 0.09, that's the same "
thing as nine percent of x-- is equal to three. 
Or that x is equal to 3 divided by 0.09. 
"Well, if we do the decimal division, 0.09 goes into 3. "
Let's put a decimal point here. 
I don't know how many zero's I'm going to need. 
"So if I move this decimal over to the right twice, then I'll "
move this decimal over to the right twice. 
So 0.09 goes into 3 the same number of times 
that nine goes into three hundred. 
So nine goes into thirty three times. 
three times nine is twenty-seven. 
I think I see a pattern here already. 
"thirty, three, three times nine is twenty-seven. "
You're going to keep getting thirty-three-- the three's are just 
going to go on forever. 
So it turns out that three is nine percent of-- you can either write it as 
33.3 repeating or we all know that 0.3 forever is the 
same thing as one / three. 
So three is nine percent of thirty-three and one / three. 
Either one of those would be an acceptable answer. 
And a lot of times when you're doing percentages you're 
actually just trying to get a ballpark. 
"The precision might not always be the most important thing, "
but in this case we will be precise. 
"And obviously, on tests and things you need to "
be precise as well. 
"Hopefully, I didn't go too fast and you have a good "
sense of percentage. 
The important thing for these type of problems is pay 
attention to how the problem is written. 
If it says find ten percent of one hundred. 
That's easy. 
You just convert ten percent to a decimal and multiply it by one hundred. 
But if I were to ask you one hundred is ten percent of what? 
You have to remember that that's a different problem. 
"In which case, one hundred is ten percent of-- and if you did the math, "
it would be one thousand. 
"I think I spoke very quickly on this problem on this module, so "
I hope you didn't get too confused. 
But I will record more. 
""
"The social order as we know it is created out of ideas, "
either directly or as a systemic consequence. 
In other words somebody somewhere did something which generated a group interest. 
Once a given set of ideas are intrusted by a large enough group of people it becomes an institution. 
"And once that institution is made dominant, while existing for a certain period of time, "
that institution can then be considered an establishment. 
Institutional establishments are simply social traditions given the illusion of permanence. 
"In turn, the more established they become the more cultural influence they tend to have on us. "
Including our values and hence our identities and perspectives. 
While there is always a debate about genetics and environmental influence. 
Its very easy to understand in the context of values- 
every intellectual concept that each one of us finds merit with 
is the result of a cultural information influence. 
The environment is a self perpetuation programing process 
and just like designing a software program for your computer 
each human being is advertently and inadvertently programed into their world view. 
Every word you know has been taught to you one way or another 
and thus every concept and belief you have is a result of this same influence. 
"Jacque Fresco once asked me, "
"""how much of you is you?"" "
Then answer of course is kind of a paradox. 
For either nothing is me or everything is me 
when it comes to the information I understand and act upon. 
"Information is a serial process, meaning the only way a human being can come up with any idea "
is through taking in dependent information that allows that idea to be realized.

the five biological laws
Third Revolution in the history of Medicine
What these five biological laws are basically about
"and what implications they have, will be illustrated by the following example."
The Cat and the Mouse
let a mouse and a cat cross their ways
The cat will notice a morsel of food.
"The mouse, on the other hand, is noticing a deadly threat."
"By its biological determination, it immediately starts running away."
"It is an experience familiar to everyone that in extreme situations unprecedented powers are set free in us,"
and precisely this is part of what we are dealing with.
"The mouse's alveolar lung cells are turned to sympathicotony,"
"which here results in hyperfunction, increasing permeability to oxygen."
Thus the mouse is able to inspire more effectively and to keep running for a prolonged period of time.
"After running for two minutes and successfully having sought refuge, the mouse will consecutively breathe and recreate for two minutes."
"It is now in a vagotonic, or parasympathetic state."
"Transferring this situation to human life, this could be receiving"
"a diagnosis of deadly cancer from your doctor, which you would assess in the same way the mouse did."
"On the biological level, the deadly diagnosis is being interpreted like the cat from which one wants to escape."
"But in contrast, we cannot run away from this diagnosis in a literal sense, contrary to biological determination."
"This fear of death is perpetuated, the patient is unable to sleep,"
"anorectic and restless, as a biological programme is active in him which tells him"
to excape from a deadly enemy.
"Now, compared to the situation with the cat and the mouse, there is a big difference in duration."
Under no circumstances will it keep fleeing constantly for weeks and months.
"In a natural environment, fear of death cannot persist for such a prolonged period of time."
"Since the cells have been working at maximum capacity for weeks, they even began to proliferate"
to keep up with the workload.
"Due to this surplus of cells, even more oxygen can be absorbed in even lesser time."
"Would our patient now visit the doctor again, he would find a so-called malignant tumor in the lung"
and conclude that this represents a metastasis of the primary cancer.
"However, it is a cancer programme on its own, triggered by that fear of death."
"This cell proliferation never was malignant or nonsensical, but biologically,"
it helped the creature in running away.
"Let's now assume that our patient is being disalarmed by the doctor, who has a good prognosis for him,"
then he would be suddenly relieved and could finally start recreating.
He successfully escaped the evil predator.
"But since additional cells have been grown for weeks, also something else will happen."
The now unnecessary surplus cells are being decomposed through tuberculosis and expectorated.
The patient will cough up coagulated blood.
"The mouse did not develop surplus cells during its two minutes of fear of death, necessitating no decomposition afterwards."
"The human patient however, now starts worrying again and seeks the doctor,"
"who now in addition will diagnose lung tuberculosis,"
this being a mere symptom of the resolution of the conflict of fear of death -
"which, while causing discomfort, represents a biologically expedient measure, whith a predetermined duration,"
roughly as long as one was caught in fear of death.
"However, decomposition of surplus cells can take place only if the organism carries the necessary tuberculi."
"In their absence, for example due to medical extermination, the tumor will encapsulate and remain at its place,"
not posing any direct threat.
"The tuberculi, always thought of as something bad, are actually no more than garbage collectors."
Indispensable helpers in reconvalescence.
"Accordingly, there was an elevated rate of lung tuberculosis in Germany after World War II,"
since many people had resolved their conflict of fear of death
"– biologically, they had fled the cat successfully."
Not in a single case was there an infection.
Lung cancer due to fear of death?
"Keep in mind that there is not only a single type of lung cancer, as the lung comprises different parts"
reacting differently from each other to different notions.
Our example specifically adressed the pulmonary alveoles.
"For the bronchial tubes, goblet cells or pleurae there are different programmes with their own triggers and courses,"
"but in any event, they are not malignant but biologically significant."
"There is never a so-called metastasis, and never is this so-called ""lung cancer"""
directly caused by smoking or other toxic agents.
"This is only possible through a biological notion of fear of death, necessitating hyperfuncion of the pulmonar aleveoles"
"and without any need to be fought against, contrary to the previously held view."
"There is no trace of any error of nature we need to repair, as was always assumed both by the established"
Were Cancer and other so-called diseases once life-savers?
"If the Five biological laws formulated by Dr. Hamer are correct, everything has been turned upside down!"
The Curse...
Cancer!
The puzzle has been solved finally!
And what about…
AIDS?
Leukaemia?
Paralysis?
Diabetes?
Likewise!
Those suffering from cancer grasp to everything that gives them a little hope for healing and life.
no wonder that they even believe the promises of charlatans.
Caught in the Death Sect!
"Now a movement is gaining support in Europe calling itself ""German New Medicine""."
"""German New Medicine"" - Hope or fraud?"
This could pass as some insane theory and would not draw our attention
if there were not so many sick walking in the trap of their absurd therapies.
You are putting different things together in a confuse system.
Your theory is built on delusion.
You are mad and in need of psychiatric treatment.
This is Dr. Hamer who has found the five biological laws.
"Why don't you verify it? I'm prepared, in front of every commission..."
"Mr. Hamer, the problem is that one cannot examine crazy and insane ideas."
May I ask you if you are able to read?
Keep quiet with such stupid remarks!
"How can you, as represantatives of the established medical school, prevent that more people walk in the trap of a psychopath and charlatan?"
This is a triumph of madness.
Physicists seriously discussing with a cracked charlatan about his insane theories...
… tolerance which is almost criminal.
Let's move on to our next subject.
"Stop! Stop! Stop! So much for the notorious ""objective"" and ""fair"" media coverage."
"Now in contrast, this documentary aims at explaining"
"what these five biological laws are about, actually,"
so that everyone can proof and judge them.
"Please, don't believe anything that's being said here unless you have examined it by yourself!"
Who knows how it really is after all?
"Dr. Hamer has summarised the five biological laws under the name ""New Medicine"","
"and later, ""German New Medicine""."
"The words ""New Medicine"", of course, do not refer to a new remedy or cure"
but to a whole new school of thought extending to the entire field of medicine
from which a new approach can be derived to achieving individual reconvalescence of humans and animals.
A shift of paradigms
"For the first time in the history of Western medicine, as far as we are able to trace it back,"
"we have a self-contained scientific system, explaining the essence and origins"
"of diseases, that is situations we are still used to calling diseases."
"So basically, in their core, the five laws of nature are not a new application, technique or substance."
"The New Medicine is a new way of conceiving origins and course of programs,"
we now call diseases and which on the basis of our present understanding
are erroneously assessed as we cannot see the significance of these symptomatic complexes.
"Those five biological laws, which have been discovered by Dr. Hamer, are are a fundamental new view"
"of what nature is, how nature works, what health and what disease is, in general."
We arrive at a whole new picture.
"This is and unprecedented idea, that these natural programs are actually benficiary to our survival."
"For me it is of highest significance, beyound individual benefit, so that I say mankind will need"
"this knowledge in the future, as it leaves no basis for racism,"
or the politics of fear that is willfully promoted in medicine. It's a precondition for the future of mankind.
I am a pharmaceutical adviser and have worked as a medical journalist.
"From 2000 onwards, I have repeatedly come across the New Medicine."
I have repeatedly dealt with it an talked to all sorts of oncologists
"throughout the country, who also take part in opinion-shaping."
And what puzzled me was that whenever I mentioned New Medicine they started stumbling.
"For example, I asked the head of a medical faculty: ""What do you think about New Medicine?"""
"He replied: ""As a reputable journalist you should not meddle with something like that."""
Gosh! That made me all the more curious.
Social scientist Paul Watzlawick recognises two types of changes
that can occur due to scientific progress.
Type 1 relates to changes in basic assumptions. That is when our basic beliefs
"about the world, about ourselves, about certain processes, fundamentally change."
Type 2 changes comprise technical aspects. Technical or methodological innovations
which leave the basic assumptions unchanged.
Type 1 changes only occur very rarely in science.
"Of course, someone who has devoted many years of his life to studying will not easily agree"
to putting into question the basic assumptions and principal theses he has learnt.
It's a revolution of medicine. It is not merely a revision like moving the furniture
in a room in order to improve the setting.
"So was the technical enhancement we have seen so far in medicine. But now, we have a true change of the room."
It's a whole new room. And this is indeed a great revolution.
"In ancient times, medical theory was resting on demonism."
"Disease was believed to be brought about by sin, and could be prevented or repelled"
through adopting a pious lifestyle or through fighting the demons by exorcism.
"Based on this religious dogm, for a long time, it was forbidden to dissect or examine the human body."
With the acceptance of autopsies and the studying of anatomy a crucial step was made leading to the First Revolution of Medicine.
"Blind demonism was abandoned in favour of a technical view on the organism,"
an exact understanding of the functioning and interactions of organs.
"Humoral pathology emerged from this revolution, as well as classical homoeopathy or Bach flower therapy."
This is also one of the pillars of contemporary medicine.
"The organism is thought of as a mere technical and biochemical system,"
"and that technical defects, imbalances, blockades are the causes of disease."
Light microscopy paved the way for a further discovery.
Things otherwise hidden from the human eye could be made visible.
"This gave rise to an atomistic school of thaught in Medicine,"
tracking the causes of disease back to ever smaller units.
"Now, for instance, microorganisms, genes and cellular mutations were held responsible."
Contemporary oncology and immunology emerged in accordance to this pattern.
"In 1981, German physician Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer laid the foundation for the Third Revolution of Medicine."
"Since then it is clear that we always had an incorrect understanding of disease,"
"and that instead, there are Significant Biological Special Procedures. We'll have more on that soon."
"These Five Biological Laws represent the Third Revolution of Medicine, a paradigm shift,"
"were nothing is anymore considered right or wrong, but only efficient from the perspective of nature."
"We are very used to, that only entitled people with ranks within the academic hierarchy are allowed"
"But if Dr. Hamer is right with his discoveries, then basically the studies of medicine"
need to be reviewed.
"To be frank - when I first heard of it, I thaught these folks are nuts."
"Then I started testing it by myself and on all my patients,"
and I had to admit it was correct.
"This means, that all this can be verified by anybody himself."
"There is no more need to believe in the titles, that were created"
to replace the verification of knowledge by anybody.
"What Dr. Hamer says, what I say, what anybody else says can be proven and checked,"
if it is true to the biological reality.
"These natural laws are no probabilistic estimates as we have known them so far,"
"but statements which, by their very syntactic structure and content,"
"can be subject to refutation. Thus, we cannot have statements like:"
"With a likelyhood of 90% this and that is the cause ... ,"
"But the rule is: either it is exactly that way, or, if there exists a single case"
"were it is different, than the whole thing is disproved."
"However, medical science is obviously satisfied with the finding of statistical correlations."
30% of all people with gastric ulcers host the microorganism Helicobacter Pylori.
The conclusion is derived from this that Helicobacter Pylori is the cause of gastric ulcers.
The fact that only 30% of all patients host Helicobacter is not even mentioned.
This was rewarded with the 2005 Nobel Prize.
"We have two attributes which are put in correlation,"
and we have a measure for the significance of this correlation.
"But this does not mean that, if one of two things is observed, the other can be expected with absolute certainty."
It was along the same lines when the 2008 Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of
correlating of Human Papilloma Virus and cervical cancer of the uterus.
"However, almost every woman hosts this virus,"
whereas cervical cancer is a rather rare gynaecological condition.
"That's what I find remarkable, that we don't have hypothetical statements anymore,"
"allowing for exceptions, but we have determinant statements"
reflecting the true causal relations.
"""Da wir aus den Ärzten Kaufleute machen, zwingen wir sie, die Handelskniffe zu erlernen."" Bernhard Shaw Englisches Original???"
This holds true in the process of licensing new medications and therapies.
"The following parable is taken from Prof. Peter Yoda's book ""revelations of a medical insider"""
„I will demonstrate on an (somewhat drastic) example how studies are conducted.
Let's assume I'm a vendor of stockings and I want to enter the market of cancer patients.
I would arrange for a study to be conducted in the following way:
All men with prostate cancer are tested for the colour of their stockings.
"Whatever the results, in any event one group will have better survival rates than the others."
"Suppose, from the group with blue stockings, 6% survive, compared to 4% of all the others."
"I would print an advertisement on glossy paper and present it to doctors in a premium hotel,"
stating that blue socks increase life expectancy by 50%.
Only afterwards we need a scientists to explain why those with blue stockings live longer.
"A possible explanation could be that blue stockings send out light waves with a frequency of 400-500nm,"
and most recent US studies (always a good phrase!) have shown that prostate cancer cells
could be destroyed more quickly when exposed to this frequency in a laboratory. Make sure to include this statement:
"These studies require further research, but first results are so promising, that we may hope to come out"
"with optimised ""Cancer Stockings"" in 3 to 4 years. The crucial point is"
that neither data nor conclusions would have to be manipulated - everything that's being said is true.
"Soon, the question won't be IF stockings do help, but WHICH stockings help BEST."
"The time will come, when everyone is convinced: If there is any hope to survive cancer, it's only with stockings."
It's a circular argument: Cancer is malignant and deadly. The only hope comes from chemotherapy.
To examine whether chemotherapy has any benefit at all is impermissable because it is the patients' only salvation.
"So, for ethical reasons, no studies can be conducted with patients not wearing any stockings,"
as stockings are there only chance to survive and must them not be denied.
"The same reasoning is employed with regard to chemo ""therapy"".."
The procedure is the same for all medication and therapies as in the stockings example.
The death rate due to chemo stockings is never evaluated.
"""In these days, Lazarus could not resurrect - too far has Medicine progressed"" Mario Marenco"
The triumphant advance of chemotherapy could only take place on the basis of a misunderstanding.
Most cancers consist of big swellings that occur in the beginning of a vagotonic repair stadium.
"Thanks to sympathicotony induced by the chemo toxics, this swelling regresses,"
which creates the delusion of a healing effect.
This will become clearer in the course of this documentary.
"In 2004, German news magazine ""Der Spiegel"" came up with an article on chemotherapy, entitled ""toxic cure without benefit""."
"Research was presented showing that there is no health improvement,"
"but ""the toxic cure has become a medical dogm."""
"The question is posed: ""But what evidence is there for patients living longer due to chemotherapy?"""
A decisive compartative study has never been conducted.
"In all clinical studies, pharmaceutical developers only compare new with old cytotoxics."
There is never a untreated control group.
"To obtain a license, it is sufficient to proof that a number of carefully selected probands"
has an ostensibly statistically significant benefit as compared to treatment with a conventional cytotoxic.
"Reference is also made to University of Heidelberg's epidemiologist Ulrich Abel,"
who expresses doubts as to the benefit of chemo therapy.
"Professor Abel, an expert for biostatistics at Heidelberg University, a leading institute in German cancer research,"
"concludes that for all cancer types, mortality is around 90%."
"That is, from 100 persons undergoing standard cancer treatment, 90 will die roughly after five years."
"The German Federal Court, in a decision I have here before me, established that"
conventional cancer therapy doesn't qualify as science-based.
"It is a disease whose origin and course they don't know,"
and whose course they cannot influence in a verifyable way . According to the Federal Court.
As for the success of conventional therapy - there is virtually no indication of its efficiency.
"Dr. Hamer treated patients in Austria. In the town of Burgau, there he maintained a center."
The patient files have recently been confiscated by criminal investigators.
"In 8 to 9 years, there were 6 to 7 thousand patients."
All of them were sought for by Austrian investigators.
Police officers found 5000 Patients alive out of 6000 listed in the files.
An invaluable qualification of Dr. Hamer's work.
70-80% of all patients treated there have survived even after many years.
These numbers are simply not met by conventional cancer treatment.
"""Der Spiegel"" quotes former director of a university hospital for gynaecology:"
"""It should arouse our concern that a growing number of doctor say:"
"I myself wouldn't allow this therapy to be given to me"""
"When cancer regresses by itself, the case is discarded on the grounds of a conjecture of misdiagnosis."
"As it is an unshakable dogm that cancer cannot regress,"
because otherwise the underlying theories couldn't be sustained.
"That is, if a malignant disease suddenly disappears and the patient survives surprisingly and contrary to all expectations,"
"this is either qualified by established medicine as a mystical ""spontaneous healing"""
or the initial diagnosis of malignancy is withdrawn.
"So when someone was in fact healed or the cancer has suddenly disappeared, it was rather questioned,"
"if the diagnosis was right, as question."
"So in the end it only said: ""There was a suspicion of"" [cancer]"
"In the end the established medicine also tries to communicate, that cancer can sometimes be healed."
"So they release studies saying, that after 5 years, there are survivors."
"They count as ""spontaneous healing"" or ""magic healing"". And they don't think, that it can't be healed."
"They rather think, ""ok, you have to get the chemo now, so you might have a chance"""
This is their way of thinking.
"""The electron microscope amplifies the size of a T-lymphocyte any number of times only to amplify our ignorance of the cell to the same magnitude"" Manu L. Kothari/Lapa A. Mehta"
"Like with stockings, there are people whose business is selling chemo ""therapy"". And they are eager to create a demand for it."
"demand is created by advertisement. But this sort of advertising differs from the sort we are used to,"
for it neither indicates its own commercial character nor who profits from it.
"Like almost all advertisements, people's fears are exploited, but of course more open than in the promotion of detergents."
Preventive screening is another big seller. The more fear people have and the more they believe in
"ending their fear by preventive screening, the better it sells."
"It is, at the same time, a dragnet search for possible patients or purchasers"
of other treatments waiting to be sold.
Demand is created by stoking deadly fear and presenting an alleged remedy.
"You're feeling well, too? Still, you could have bowel cancer. For it is only felt when it is too late."
"But if detected in time, it is 100% curable. Take part with me in bowel screening."

"Signed by several VIPs, all of whom happened to have said exactly the same words"

Money can flow only if cancer is depicted as malignant and necessarily lethal.
Only one single patient convinced of chemo therapy brings hundreds of thousands of Euros.
Doctors are still obliged to offer chemo therapy under the thread of losing their license.
"Established medicine keeps the view, that the disease, as an example ""cancer"","
"sprawls throughout the body like a savage beast, duplicating itself,"
being an autonomous process.
This may work as a self fulfilling prophecy for the patient.
"That is, because we do have different biological programs, which may react to just that imagination, that something within us is wrong,"
"that there is an attack happening. For example the peritoneum, which may,"
"only by the fear of diagnosis or prognoses establish a new process,"
"which confirms, what has been said."
"And of course, we need to understand, that every kind of diagnosis,"
"as it is done today by established medicine, is only a glimpse of that moment."
"So if I have an abdominal-CT or if I measure the blood values, this is only a photography"
"of this precise moment, of this second in which I have made this examination."
"I cannot tell, what was going on 10 minutes ago. I can't tell, what will be there in 10 minutes."
"In established medicine they believe, that if there is a cancerous process,"
that this will keep growing and that this will keep proceeding.
"Now if a patient shows up, who has had a cancerous process, which has now disappeared or is no more visible,"
"this will be counted to the few cases of ""spontaneous remission"","
which are no further explained.
"In fact we forget, that all those statistics, all those experiences are made inside of the hospital."
"This means, that all those numbers, all those statistics we have, all those of how many cases and the process of different diseases,"
all those are only documentations of the achievements inside the established medicine.
"What's happening to people that don't even visit the doctors,"
"when they are having a symptom, we don't know. This is not recorded."
"So there is a huge area of which we don't know, what is happening."
"Because of that, we cannot finally say, what is happening in general, what is going on there, based on the knowledge of the established medicine."
"Based on the view of the 5 laws of nature, we have a very precise prognosis, very precise knowledge of what is going on,"
what will be the next step of this tissue process?
"The fact is ignored that a long life can be achieved without preventive screening and even with multiple cancers,"
"In general, the fact that so-called diseases can disappear without medical intervention,"
is unthinkable in our culture.
"In February of 2009 we met with Christoph Buck, who has had testicular cancer"
and got rid of it without any medical intervention.
He was able to identify every stage of the condition in light of the five biological laws.
"I had recognised an induration in my right testicle,"
it feels like all your pants are too tight.
Suddenly I became afraid.
I saw an urologist in Stuttgart.
The first view was of course alarming.
"So he carried out an ultrasound examination. He said, with 95% certainty, this was a malignant testicular tumor."
"Now you have cancer. This was shocking, first."
"Suddenly it struck me that some months earlier, I had read something in the internet (about New Medicine)."
"And what was interesting was that this Dr. Hamer had had testicular cancer, too."
"And after he recognised testicular cancer in himself, he drew a link to the death of his son."
"This specific testicular program serves the biological benefit to increase fertility,"
in order to compensate for the loss of a beloved one by begetting new offspring.
"Of course, our biological nature disregards civilised moral values"
that forbid us to simply replace a deceased by someone else.
"Here, it is all about survival of the species."
"We see, again, this cancer has nothing malignant, detrimental or wrong in it, either."
"I compared my situation to his theory, as he later concluded"
that testicular cancer is evoked by an experience of loss.
It was easy for me to determine this conflict in my case.
"I knew my conflict immediately, and I knew it was resolved,"
and my situation coincided with what Dr. Hamer in his publications had presented as the healing stage.
"Testicular tumor is not the ordinary sort of tumor one would think of, growing to a compact mass."
during the active stage of the conflict it produces tissue defects i. e. cellular depletion.
When the conflict has been resolved this cellular depletion halts and the healing stage begins.
with restitution of this defect.
And this process brings about swelling.
the symptom of which is an enlarged and indurated testicle.
The entire process was completed by December.

The assumptions of all past medical revolutions have one thing in common:
"Nature is conceived as arbitrary, malignant, erroneus."
"Either, when disease is regarded as a punishment for human sins,"
"or as the consequence of a nebulous defect or abundance,"
or as the conseqence of the invasion by a different species
or even as an attack by the organism on itself -
it is always about nature acting against us.
Under no circumstance this new medicine is just another alternative within the pool of all those alternatives.
It gives us a fundamental new view.
"First of all it does not change what we are doing, but why we are doing it."
"No matter if we take globuli, minerals, antibiotics, cytostatics, or other substances"
in each case the underlying theory derives their significance from the motive for their application.
"The change of conceptions as brought about by the five biological laws, does not mean,"
"that new products, new fighting techniques are introduced, but the question is posed:"
Does this war whithin our organism really exist?
Has any observed disease really emerged from this hypothetical war?
"For example, to use an antibiotic in order to fight bacteria, or to take vitamins in order to strengthen the immune system,"
is both based on the same world view - the organism being at war.
All the therapeutical instruments at our disposal -
"it may be massage, osteopathy, surgery,"
or technically developed methods of examination -
are now applied very sensibly in the context of a knew knowledge.
"The president of the scientific committee of our ALBA organisation, Danilo Toneguzzi,"
"a committee of now 19 medical doctors,"
"says: Now we physicians can feel pleasure in our work, again."
In principle the New Medicine is the basic understanding of therapy.
It tells us what health is in general and how we can achieve it.
"And this is the pleasure those doctors feel again, thanks to this precise theory."
"At each time, the ruling dogma was considered as undoubtedly and indisputably true."
"What we consider indisputable and normal today, was unthinkable in earlier times."
"And perhaps, something we consider unthinkable today is the basis for tomorrow's science."
And like Andreas Vesalius took a firm stance against the ecclesial taboo
"and promoted the opening of the human body,"
people of our time firmly demand a fundamental rethinking of medicine.
And they are just as forcefully fought and ridiculed.
It is ardently believed that we already know everything we can know.
As if our present science had gone beyond everything earlier.
"A science editor, a physicist, Dr. Frank Ochmann, who is still writing for the ""Stern"" magazine,"
"back in 92, 93 paid me money for attending some non-conformist AIDS conference in Zürich,"
and writing an article about it.
"It was never published. Later I met him again, personally."
I asked him: Why don't you come up with it? He said: It's not yet the time for it.
We've got Magic Johnson under contract - it's not yet the time.
"Regarding the theory of infection in connection with an influenca pandemic,"
"I talked to one official Mr. Betzer from the German environmental agency,"
and he told me:
"No, if you were right, we would have to rewrite the entire biological science, and why would we?"
The economic reshaping that would follow the acception of the New Medicine
"on short terms, poses a big threat to many of us, but"
"if we accept it readily, we will see a great chance for the creation"
"many new jobs and new branches of industry, above all, non-centralistic industrial branches."
... failed again. Why? Former head of the German health agency Horst Seehofer made the experience.
Today he admits: He couldn't stand the pharmaceutical pressure groups.
"Does it mean that the pharamceutical industry was more powerful than the politicians,"
and you were forced to withdraw?
"Yes. So it has been for the last thirty years, and until now,"
that reasonable structural changes in the German health care system
are impossible due to the resistance of the pharamceutical pressure groups.
The pharmaceutical industry succeeded - exerting massive pressure.
I can only state the fact that it is working just like that - and very effectively.
"But it is unacceptable that the industry is more powerful than legislators,"
"in the end, politicians must say: Not that way!"
"Yes, I cannot disagree with you."
Pharmaceutical research is one of the pillars
of what we call the German HighTech Base.
"And at this point I would like to recall, that the pharmaceutical industry"
very much depends on stable long term investment conditions.
like on the protection of intellectual property by reasonable and judicially valid regulations in patent law.
The development of a new pharmaceutic agent requires an average funding of 800 Millions of Euros
and takes an average time of ten years.
"It follows that unless after the development and production of such a new agent,"
"there reliable possibilities to regain what has been invested,"
research will not continue in Germany or in Europe.
And here I want to state for my government: We are eager for Germany not only to be
"a base for production, but also for pharamceutical research."
"""Research is the best medicine"""
says the current information campaign of the industrial association for pharmaceutical research.
And I think this slogan is well chosen.
This pharmaceutical research fits into the federal government's HighTech strategy.
The Fifth Biological Law
"Like the mouse could escape the cat only thanks to the special programme of the alveolar lung cells,"
"each and every special programme, in a certain situation, is necessary for the survival of a subject."
"So Dr. Hamer defined these processes earlier misrepresented as disease,"
"as ""phylogenetically understandable Significant Biological Special Program"" or SBS"
"The aspect of ""phylogenetically understandable"" is also highly important."
"The fifth law of nature is the questioning of our actual beliefs regarding the disease, the illness."
And this is why many people are doing hard in understand that.
The fifth law of nature is the understanding of every so called disease or illness as a meaningfull biological program of nature.
"And this sounds easy, but it's hard to understand and hard to integrate."
"Because, now at once the disease, which has made us suffer, which has created symptoms"
"which even created death, shall be a meaningful reaction of nature."
And this seems to be in a contradiction to what is there.
"What we do not understand is, that those reactions of nature are meant to work for a biological way of living."
"And most parts of our society do not allow that, live very unbiological. Though we are not living regarding our biological code,"
those reactions of nature are much more in number and stronger as they are intended to be in the wilderness.
"And this leads to that all those symptoms, that come from those reactions"
are also more in number and stronger as they are intended by nature.
"And this is what we call ""disease""."
"For example, the so called ""conflict of starvation"". If an animal out there in the wilderness experiences a conflict of starvation,"
this is always related to a real situation of starvation.
"it realizes at once, ""oh, nothing more to eat"", danger of starvation."
"Initially starting from this moment, there is an alternation of the liver tissue. The liver cells change and increase the function."
It produces more enzymes and it allows a better storage of glycogen.
"and everything that can be found, every kind of grass, everything will be used better, more efficiently for creating a bigger chance of survival."
From the same moment the liver tissue begins to grow. New cells begin to grow.
"Now, what can you assume? How long can an impala live out there in the wilderness"
"If we assume about 6 or 7 weeks, it means that if for 6 or 7 weeks,"
this animal doesn't find any new food it will die from starvation.
If we find the dead impala and cut it open and we examine the liver. What will we find?
maybe we'll find that it's a little slightly bigger.
and more life-threatening than the procedure affecting the organ.
"It is for improving the chance of survival for this animal,"
within the timelapse that nature allows for this biological program.
"Now, a human being can experience a conflict of starvation from another situation."
"The big difference is, that if you lack money, if you are broke, you will not die from starvation within 6 or 7 weeks."
"You can keep this program, you can keep this problem running for months, even for years."
"And if you have experienced that conflict of starvation, because of your lack of financial support"
"the liver tissue will keep on growing, will keep on processing, just as if you were"
in a real situation of starvation. And from the huge timeframe
"there can be a big tumorous growth. And also from the beginning of this biological program, we have a growth, an augmentation of the liver tissue."
"Now, for a biological living being, there is a limited timeframe, which this animal has, for the solution of this problem."
"If the impala dies within 6 or 7 weeks without finding anything to eat, any nourishment"
"the human being can live within that situation of feeling to starve, from lack of financial support, for months or for years."
"So the tissue process will keep going, keep going on."
"Nature intends to change, to improve the situation by improving the organic function."
"But by the fact, that a human being will not die from for example the lack of financial support"
"we keep going, we keep growing in the process, until we reach huge dimensions"
which then are called cancerous disease.
"So basically we can say, what we call disease today is not intended as that by nature."
"It is only created by our unbiological living and lifestyle, which creates huge timeframes for those biological programs"
until we find or do not find a solution.
Aber kein Tier in freier Wildbahn wird Monate lang in der blanken Todesangst leben.
Let's have a look at the conflict of fear of death.
is when being confronted with a predator or a life endangering situation.
"Naturally this situation, fear of death, for a living being out there in nature may keep going for minutes, maybe for seconds."
"But within the timeframe there will be a decision,"
"if our animal can flee successfully, or if it will be killed by the predator."
"and the doctor tells you, that this cancer, this thing, is living inside of you like a predator,"
"eating you up from the inside, and this is pretty much how it is explained and describe to the people,"
how can you flee from that predator? How can you get away from this situation?
"You can't! And the biological program, if you have experienced this conflict fear of death, will keep on going, will keep on growing."
"And after a while you will be diagnosed with metastases in the lung, because of this conflict fear of death"
and your situation from which you cannot escape.
"So now we understand, that our believe systems,"
our abilities to interpretate and to believe the sayings of other people allow us
to create biological programs from which we cannot escape.
And those are situations which create huge organic situations.
"Huge diseased situations, which need to be interveined."
"The fifth biological law of nature tells us, that those processes are meaningful,"
"and even if an organic process is dangerous and needs to be treated, it has a biological meaning and purpose."
It helps us on the psychological level to try keep on going and finding a solution.
"From the 5. law of nature we understand, that there is nothing such"
For there is no malignancy in nature.
The assumption of malignant cancer cells swimming away and producing secondary tumors at other places
can likewise only be found in textbooks now outdated.
"As for the theory of metastases, if we look at it in detail,"
many different events would have to be observed in order to back this theory.
One would have to observe exactly:
- the separation of a cancer cell from the tumor.
- the migration of this cell through the blood or lymphatic system.
- its settling in a different organ.
- infiltration of this organ.
"In fact, besides the possibility of finding any number of cancer cells in the blood,"
"all the other hypothesised processes are neither verifiable, nor are there answers to questions like"
that why a metastasis doesn't settle in neighbouring organs like the wall of blood vessels.
"The following will explain why multiple tumors in one organism do exist, after all."
"""Nature has no sense of joking, it is ever true, ever solemn, ever strict;"
"it is ever right, and all mistakes and errors are man's."" Goethe"
The First Biological Law
"It says, that every physiological situation, which is not induced by a poisoning, by a scarcity or an injury"
"is the result of a so called biological conflict, which is defined DHS by Dr. Hamer."
Each of the Special Programmes we used to call diseases earlier will only begin
when we notice a conflict with our biologial needs.
"Examples of biological conflicts are cessation of food supply,"
"not being able to live our sexual needs,"
when we face a deadly threat.
This might as well be a situation which is dramatic and visible for outstanders
like the unexpected death of a family member.
"But also a single word in an argument, that you didn't expect."
Like an accusation or something.
The varieties and possibilities for the biological conflict are as far and wide as possibilities to interpretate and feel for a human being.
So it's just plain impossible to list them up.
Do you see a connection between the death of your son and your testicular cancer?
"Not only do I see a connection, but I have proved it exactly in more than 600 cases,"
"there is an exact relation, and all my colleagues are revolted by my calling this a law,"
"but in every case where the histological finding is exact, there is this connection."
"Dr. Hamer named the biological conflict Dirk Hamer Syndrome or DHS,"
"in honour of his son Dirk, after whose death he acquired testicular cancer,"
which opened his eyes to finding the First Biological law.
"Dr. Hamer underwent surgery of his cancer, what many try to use against him."
But they ignore that this happened before he made his discovery.
That's not entirely fair. And he emphasises that he wouldn't have had it done with his later knowledge.
The First Biological Law consists of three criteria. The first criterion defines the three moments of the DHS.
These are the preconditions for a Special Programme to take place.
"and it was isolating, this means, there was no sympathy or understanding by others,"
or there was noone to talk to about the problem.
In no way do similar situations always produce the same symptoms.
Imagine five people who go to their common workplace one morning
where they are informed that they lost their job.
And each of the five persons conceives this information in a different way.
What happens?
"Mr. A sees his job mainly as a source of income to make his living,"
"it gives him his ""daily bread""."
"The closing of the company for him is highly acute and dramatical, as his ""daily bread"" is endangered now."
"He feels isolated, for he lives alone and cannot share his sorrow."
He suffers a biological conflict with the content of starvation.
"Mr. A develops a liver hyperfunction with subsequent cell proliferation, if the conflict remains active for an extended period of time."
As soon as he finds a new source of income the cancer will automatically be decomposed.
The hyperfunction and the tumor of the liver help him to extract more nutritive substances from little food.
Mr B is among the higher echelons in the company which he sees as a source of personal importance.
"It's for him to decide and to direct. In biological terms, it is his territory."
The closing down of the company is highly acute and dramatic for him as his source of importance
and authority has suddenly disappeared.
"Whithout this company he is a ""Nobody""."
The closing down is unexpected.
"He suffers a biological conflict of ""losing one's territory""."
Mr B's coronary arteries widen and might cause heart aching.
"this provides for better oxygenisation of the heart, so he has more power to regain his territory."
"After the resolution of the conflict, he will develop bradyarrhythmia, a special kind of heart attack."
"Mr C had always identified himself with the company, being proud when it was running well,"
losing self esteem when it was running badly.
"The sudden closing down came as a devastating defeat for him,"
"especially, as he was not even informed in time."
"He suffers a conflict of central self-devaluation: ""I am a loser""."
"Mr C experiences a cellular depletion in the vertebrate column. Upon resolving the conflict,"
"restitution of vertebrate bone or intervertebrate disks will begin, causing back pain for some time."
Mr D sees the company merely as a source of extra-income.
"His big family maintains him. As his territory, he doesn't regard his workplace,"
but rather his marital life.
"Therefore, the closing down of the company is not highly-acute nor dramatic for him."
"While being isolating and unexpected, he suffers no conflict as the dramatic aspect ist lacking."
"For Mr D, no special programme becomes necessary."
Mr E is actually a standard case:
"He suffers three conflicts at a time, as all contents are dramatic for him."
"He develops the symptoms of A, B und C."
We see from this example that several people can have a completely different assessment of the same situation.
They can suffer different conflicts or no conflict at all.
The therapeutical approach taken in each of these cases would have to be based
indivudually on each specific background.
"Of course, these were only three possibilities of assessing the situation."
"Starvation, loss of one's territory and self-devaluation."
But there is still an infinite number of other possible interpretations.
It's an entirely individual thing. there is no general rule.
"For example, the release of adrenaline is obligatory in every conflict."
That is a hyperfunction of the adrenal marrow.
"So there are many programmes that start in every conflict, because they are always efficient."
"It is something known to everybody: When you experience any small conflict,"
the heartrate increases immediately.
This is a special programme as well.
"So there is not only one special programme triggered by each conflict, but there are always several ones."
The Second Criterion - the locus
The Second Criterion determines which Special Programme is triggered by which conflict.
Or which assesment of a conflict necessitates which Special Programme.
"Of course, this has to do, among other things, with the role played by specific organs"
so as to act efficiently under the Special Programme.
"In some organs, this connection is obvious -"
The liver intensifies its function in a conflict related to nutrition.
The bladder is involved in the marking of one's territory.
"Or as for the skin, it is about sensing, touching, keeping contact with others."
But it is not that obvious for all organs.
"A moment ago, we had the example of five people losing their job and reacting to this in completely different ways."
Here is an example of the opposite case.
Several people experience entirely different situations but assess them in exactly the same way.
Consider three persons: A man attempts to decorate his office which is forbidden by his boss.
"A small child attempts to lock itself in its room,"
"but Daddy doesn't allow it, as in their family it is forbidden to lock oneself in."
Finally an adolescent girl whose mother is meddling with her affairs all the time.
So that she cannot make her own decisions whithout the mother getting involved.
All three have one thing in common: They suffer from occasional bladder inflammations.
"What is the least common denominator in their sensing of the conflict, is the marking of their respective territories."
Each of them is prevented from marking or delimiting his territory.
The man can not decorate his office in order to make it his territory.
"The child cannot lock itself in its room in order to delimit its realm, as Daddy's opposed to it."
"And in the girl, we see the female manifestation of this conflict of marking the territory."
"She is less concerned with the outer territory, but more with her personal identity."
She cannot set boundaries between herself and her mother.
"In essence, we have the same sensing of the conflict in all of them, although it appears so unequal."
This is hard to understand in the beginning.
All the more difficult is it to characterize the conflictive contents in a way everybody will find useful.
Many beginners are disappointed by Dr. Hamer's scientific chart.
As it is significantly more difficult to employ than expected.
it is clearly different.
"Another important finding is that from this moment, the Special Programme"
"is running simultaneously on the three levels of psyche, brain and organ."
"It is a common misunderstanding that the psyche triggers the Special Programmes,"
"while in fact, the conflict is perceived by our integral biological organism,"
effecting symptoms on all three layers.
"What we experience on the psychical level through our thoughts,"
"a change of our view towards the world, is a symptom, not a cause."
Please keep in mind: We are NOT talking about psychological conflicts. The psyche is NOT causing diseases.
Precisely this conception of so called psychosomatics is refuted by the Five Biological Laws.
"The biological conflict, perceived by all senses we command,"
triggers a Special Programme which helps us to solve the biological problem.
"On the psychical level, from this moment on, there is an obsessive dwelling over the conflict"
and an obsessive searching for a resolution helping us to get rid of the problem as soon as possible.
So this is a highly important part of the survival strategy.
Our actions are directed accordingly.
"In the organ related to each type of biological conflict, a functional change takes place"
helping to solve the problem.
Every organ is related to a certain center in the brain.
These are at the same time the centers for all our biological notions
"and, through the psyche, they also control our feeling and acting."
"For example, this locus in the brain stem controls the liver"
and is therefore in part responsible for our quest for food.
These loci in the cerebellum control the mammary glands
and the need to feed a helpless creature milk.
The epidermis and therefore our sense of touch and need for contact
are controlled by the sensory area of the cerebral cortex.
"On the cerebral level, at the locus inside the brain controlling the respective organ,"
"we see a circular structure called ""Hamer Focus""."
"These Hamer Foci consist of articulate rings that can be seen only in a CT scan performed without a contrast agent,"
but even this usually requires several years of training. They cannot be seen in MRI.
"When clearly seen, established medicine discards them as technical artifacts."
The strict synchronicity between the three levels allows for exact deductive conclusions from one level to the others.
A trained CT reader can tell from a brain CT scan what psychical and organical
"So if the cerebral center for the alveolar lung cells is seen active in a CT scan, it can be concluded with certainty"
"that the person has improved breathing and perhaps cell proliferation of the alveoles,"
and that he is bothering with an unresolved fear of death.
"Accordingly, from a specific organical symptom,"
feelings and cerebral conditions can be predicted.
Experienced therapists can even draw conclusions
to organ and cerebral conditions from a psychological anamnesis.
"It is only natural that the psychical level is most difficult to evaluate,"
"depending, among other things, on a person's mental state and how readily he speaks about intimate feelings."
"Perfect predictions, however, can be made from brain CT images for the organ and psychical levels"
provided that appropriate technical devices are accessible.
"I abandoned it almost completely, for, due to my working experience as a nurse,"
"when I see a patient in front of me, I know what's the matter with him."
"So, as a rule, I don't need a CT scan."
"After all, I think it's great to say we can do CT-reading, but it's generally overestimated."
We have to look at the patient as a whole and not only at a CT image.
I was puzzled when someone called and asked me whether I can do CT-reading.
"And I said: No, the patient has to come here, I have to look at him."
Jesus! I would never restrict myself to CT-reading.
The three levels are unseparable from each other.
"The feeling of grief, fear etc. (depending on the specific biological conflict)"
is not the cause of the corresponding organic procedure.
"It is a consequence of the conflict - the change in thinking is part of the natural strategy to find a solution,"
as all thoughts are solely orbiting around the problem.
Example: The liver on all three levels
The notion of no ore insufficient food necessitates a hyperfunction.
In the corresponding brain center we see a Hamer Focus.
"Both on the organ and psychic level, we develop hyperfunction in this example."
"On the organ level, nutrients are extracted much more effectively from the food."
"On the psychic level, we are obsessed with thinking about finding a new source of food,"
A trivial everyday example:
Imagine to bite into this tart and juicy lemon.
You will immediately notice increased salivary production.
"If this is the case, than you have cancer right now!"
There is a conflict with regard to normal functioning.
In this case it is recognised that there is not enough saliva for this tart fruit in the mouth.
The salivary glands react immediately with increasing of their function.
"If, for example, I experience of ""I cannot get the morsel"","
"and the morsel is always a thing that is necessary or needful for my survival,"
this will affect the right tonsil or the right salivary gland.
this will only lead to an increased production of secretion of enzymes for catching the morsel more effectively.
"If I can handle the situation, when I solve the conflict or it levels by itself,"
"the process will be revised and I have a swelling in this area,"
"my mouth is a little dry at this spot, and then the process is finished."
If I can not solve the situation for a long period of time or if it is
"reoccuring over and over again, this will lead to an increased growth and function, change of cells, change of the histology"
and which in the end will look like a tonsil carcinoma.
"Of course, this cannot happen with regard to ordinary food."
"But if it is about something we perceive like food biologically,"
"for example if we deem it vital, the same case can occur."
"So the question if there is just a change in function or a tumorous growth, a cancerous situation,"
this question is only defined by the intensity and the length of the process.
"So it would be wrong to say, which is still not understood right by many people,"
that a certain conflict causes a certain symptom.
"In the first place, it is required that the situation is dramatic for a person."
How is the situation being interpreted? And the duration of the conflict is also decisive.
"In a short-termed conflict, no big organic procedure can have place."
"but in the opposite direction, we can make definite statements."
"If a certain symptom is clearly recognisable,"
"than, in any case it must be preceded by the corresponding conflict. But it's not the other way round."
"We cannot say: This conflict was present, so that symptom must result."
"This conclusion may prove correct, but not necessarily. But vice versa, we have natural laws."
Often it has to be understood that an organ is not monolithic.
Let's look to the breast as an example – it consists of different parts and tissues.
mammary glands - mammary ducts - adipose tissue - corium - epidermis.
"Avoid for this reason inaccurate wordings like ""breast cancer""."
Example: Mammary Glands
"Assume a mother has breastfed her child, her breasts are now empty."
Now she's having a walk with her child happily sleeping in the stroller.
"Now, unexpectedly, she hears a newborn child terribly screaming."
And she feels immediately her breasts being filled with milk.
"So it's a biological response, if there's a small child that is not well,"
"But now, if this situation not only lasts for a brief moment but for a prolongued period of time,"
"for example, when the child is ill, in hospital, severely ill,"
"and the mother is afraid that it won't recover, again, her biological response is to try and produce milk."
"But due to the prolongation, the mammary gland is even increasing in size."
The significance of which is to produce even more milk.
"But without knowledge of this, whithout understanding the biological significance, we'll only see a node in the breast."
Which we call breast cancer.
"This is a whole new view of the entire process, medicine refers to as disease."
We have seen that the mammary glands develop hyperfunction when a helpless creature demands care.
A case in point could be when one's own child hurts itself.
"But in a civilisational environment, there are other causes of sorrow."
"E. g. the child has bad marks in school, which arouses concern about its future life."
Or it suffers from anything else which makes the mother worry.
"Hyperfunction of the mammary glands also becomes necessary,"
"if the ""family nest"" ist endangered or destroyed."
"In our civilisation, this could be the house protecting the familiy."
"In all cases, the surplus in milk production is aimed at assisting others"
and helping them through a hard time.
"Experience has taught us, however, that women also react with their mammary glands"
to conflicts with other close persons such as their partners.
"In essence, we arrive at a conflict of caring and/or quarreling."
"Everything is possible. What matters, is solely the biological interpretation of any conflict."
"A woman not currently breastfeeding, will not produce milk in spite of the activity of the Special Programme."
but her breasts will only secrete a serous liquid.
"Which is likely to be connected to the fact that in nature, a mother is almost uninterruptedly breastfeeding,"
as she is giving birth in short sequence
for which reason menstruation is more frequent in civilisation than in nature.
But mind that everything being said here is only valid for the mammary glands!
The other parts of the breast have show their significant reactions in other circumstances.
A synopsis of these can be derived from the Third Biological Law.
"If there is a growth of the mammary glands, there is always a conflict of care and/ore quarrel."
"Whereas the inaccurate word ""breast cancer"" should be abandoned."
The Second Biological Law
The Second Biological Law has pivotal significance in the practical work in accordance with the Biological Laws.
"It follows from the normal functioning of the autonomic nervous system,"
"which regulates all of our somatic procedures, based on our sensations, and without our arbitrary interference."
The autonomic nervous systems is made up of two branches: sympathic and vagal.
"During daytime, we are usually in a sympathetic state."
"We are restless, energetic and busy."
"Vagotonia is the state of recreation. Now we're digesting, sleeping or relaxing. Powers spent before are being rebuilt."
"This is why we become tired after meals, as digestion is a regenerative vagotonic procedure."
"Sympathicotonia and vagotonia are antagonists, neutralising and succeeding each other in a regular rhythm."
Each side giving rise to the other.
"For example, if you are always active until late night during the week, i. e in a sympathicotonic state,"
"with short vagotonic periods of rest, you will compensate for this on weekends with prolonged vagotonia."
You will sleep as long as necessary to restore the equilibrium.
"Those physical conditions we used to consider unnormal begin at the moment when a major conflict occurs,"
turning our regular life upside down.
We may observe this in the example of the mouse in the face of death.
"It is turned to total sympathicotony all of a sudden, as its life is at stake with no time for recreation left."
This is called the conflict active phase.
"The clinical signs can be verified by every layman, a doctor doesn't need any instruments:"
"cold hands, obsessive dwelling over the conflict situation, anorexia,"
insomnia and highly increased metabolic activity.
"Also elevated levels of stress hormones like cortisol, released by the adrenal glands."
The benefit of which is to assist us in the situation we are faced with
"the body is made fit so that we can be powerful, effective, need little sleep,"
lack appetite so as not to burden the digestive apparatus with work
and providing us energy to solve the current conflict or the problem as quickly as possible.
"If this continues for weeks and months, the patient will lose weight and look unhealthy."
This is what we call the sympathicotonic phase.
"As the specific example deals with a conflict ""fear of death"", the alveolar lung cells are turned to sympathicotonia, as well."
The mouse achieves resolution of the conflict immediately by escaping safely.
"In a safe place, or when the resolution of the conflict is recognised,"
"its body is turned to vagotonia, it recreates and regains its powers."
"The symptoms of the conflict active phase disappear, the mouse is tired and weak."
There is nothing remarkable about this.
But compare this to the human equivalent of a patient receiving his lethal diagnosis.
He is turned to total sympathicotonia as well. All of his thoughts are solely dedicated to this conflict.
"His hands are cold, he is unable to eat anything."
"with the conflict unresolved, he remains in the sympathicotonic state during the night."
"It is almost impossible for him to sleep, as in biological terms,"
he has to escape a deadly enemy.
"Due to the increased activity of his alveoles, his respiration works very well."
"If this condition persists for half a year or a year on a constant level,"
the patient will never be able to recreate sufficiently and will emaciate.
Which can result in kachexia and death.
Usually we learn to live with our conflicts.
"In this case, they lose intensity and sometimes we forget them alltogether."
So please don't panic and say - Help! What if I have some active conflicts?.
Oh no! I will emaciate - or along those lines. You would surely recognise a conflict from which you could emaciate.
And then you wouldn't have any time to worry about these things.
"When I have still time to bother myself with these things, my conflicts are not severe enough."
"When I really face serious conflicts, my thoughts orbit around them day and night,"
and I try to get things straight again. Then I cannot concentrate on anything else.
"At the same time, constant activity of alveolar lung cells results in their proliferation"
"and hyperplasia, and on the next visit to the doctor,"
"this will be misdiagnosed as ""pulmonar metastases""."
"""Now the cancer has already spread into the lungs""."
Which diagnosis will of course exacerbate the patient's fear of death.
The constant emaciation further weakens the patient from day to day.
And everybody will falsely believe that the cancer has weakened and agonised him
so that his lifepower is fading away.
But the truth is that permanent stress prevents him from recreating.
He keeps spending all of his resources without restoring them.
"""Prudently the doctor poses a devastating diagnosis, lest no one doubts that he is wise:"
Because in case the patient dies - and be it only from that shock - They'll say: As foreseen by the Doc!
"But if he saves the patient, though, then as a genius he shall go...!"" Eugen Roth"
"Now let our patient after one month become disalarmed by the doctor for whatever reason,"
"this resolution of his conflict brings him to vagotonia,"
which in this case at the same time is a repair or healing phase.
"One month's sympathicotonia must now be ""made good for"" in the form of vagotonia,"
in order to restore the equilibrium.
"From the moment of the resolution on, the patient is tired for one month, he has warm hands, appetite,"
"is able to concentrate on other things, like reading a book,"
which would have been impossible during conflict activity.
"Without knowledge of the Five Biological Laws, this condition was considered a disease,"
its regenerative character had escaped our notion.
"It means, there are many different diagnoses of established medicine"
"referring to a single biological program, within it's different phases or courses,"
depending on how often it reoccurs of if it passes with once.
Modern established medicine does not regard these different phases of course.
"This might be caused by the fact, that the first conflict active phase usually shows up with little symptoms,"
"or at least with symptoms, that are seldomly defined as illness."
About 80% of illness related symptoms show up after conflict solution.
One notable observation can be made in every repair stage.
"Roughly in the middle of this process, there is a short intermezzo of high sympathicotonia - the so called epicrisis."
"Symptoms of which are several forms of heart attacks, epilepsy,"
"panic, vomiting, sneezing, colics and others."
These are necessary stages in the repair phase of several Special Programmes.
"We are used to consider them as moments of disease, of something going wrong,"
"but these phenomena are not the result of errors either, but strictly obey biological rules."
"The epicrisis cannot be bypassed in going through the repair phase,"
"and, under certain circumstances, it can be lethal."
"We'll come back to the epicrisis and what's behind it, later."
"The graphic presentation of the two phases is, of course, merely schematic."
It doesn't mean that we don't need any sleep for months.
"It only means, that the day-night-succession is shifted up- or downwards."
"So for example during conflict activity, one still gets sleep, but much less."
The areas between each the conflict active and post-conflict-resolution lines and the middle line are equal.
"That is, they don't need to have the same duration or intensity."
It's the product of both which is decisive. And this is exactly equal in both phases.
"""Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little,"
"to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they know nothing"" Voltaire"
"From the Second Biological Law, the law of the two phases, it can be derived"
whether medical interference makes sense or not at a certain point.
"The usage of medication, regarding the ""new medicine"" is focused on taking influence on the different phases."
"That means, if I'm stuck in a strong activity due to a conflict, I could achieve a tranquillization."
"If I find myself in a strong phase of regeneration, which is showing up strong symptoms,"
"medication could be used to lower these symptoms, by reducing the intensity of that phase."
"The one thing, that has never been there and will never be there is a substance that heals."
"the former stimulate the sympathic nerves and increase sympathicotonia,"
the latter stimulate the vagus and parasympathic nerves and increase vagotonia.
If a patient in a conflict active sympathicotone phase is given sympathicomimetics
"such as Cortisone or Aspirine, sympathicotonia will increase and the active phase will progress even more intensely."
Parasympathicomimetics would alleviate it.
"As symptoms of the active phase are rather seldom felt,"
the question of medication arises chiefly in the repair phase.
Because it is then that we have pain and feel unwell.
Sympathiconic interference alleviates the symptoms of the repair phase.
"This means they become less strong. But in turn, the repair process is slowed down accordingly."
So mitigation results in a prolongation of the healing phase.
What is not possible is to skip a repair process using medicine.
Skipping of the entire phase would prevent necessary repair.
"Vitamin C for example has a sympathicotonic effect and mitigates repair symptoms. This is why it is thought to be ""healthy""."
"But also coke or coffee, through their coffeine, have a sympathicotonic effect, so according to the old logics, they are ""healthy"", too."
The conception of a disease as an error of nature
that can be ceased through medicine is far from reality.
"Sometimes it seemed to be like that, as we didn't know the context of the two phases."
Abusive sympathicotonic interference can even turn the nervous system entirely back to sympathicotonia.
In which case the repair process stops completely and the symptoms of the conflict active phase recommence.
"Additional conflict mass is built ""above the line"" which afterwards has to be reduced"
"""below the line"" and that is whith repair symptoms."
"When the effect of the medicine fades, the repair process can continue."
"To suppress the symptoms again medically, can lead into a never-ending circle."
This is however only one of several ways to make a condition chronic.
"It is clear that vagotonic medicine exacerbates the symptoms of the healing phase,"
but also abrreviates it by accelerating the repair processes.
"According to this so called ""New Medicine"", medication is neither forbidden nor disgraced,"
as often falsely reported.
What's new is that we know more exactly when to employ which remedy.
The patient exercises all responsibility himself and decides either to endure certain symptoms
or to mitigate or delay them.
"In some situation which could end up lethal, medication or surgery is obligatory."
Sympathicotone or vagotone intervention is not only achieved by medicine in the form of pills etc.
"When I put an ice bag on my head or do sports, I'll become sypathicotone, as well."
"Or if I go to the sauna, I'll become vagotone."
"The statement that, according to Dr. Hamer, one should do nothing"
"and will be healed passively, is widely believed but far from reality."
It is either a misunderstanding or a piece of wilful disinformation.
Waiting is not a good idea. Waiting means doing nothing.
"And right now, by knowing the 5 laws of nature we understand, that doing something is very important."
An effective therapy often involves a fundamental restructuration of lifestyle.
A change of things we are used to. Not just the passiveness of taking the pill.
Of course the physical condition needs to be guided and controlled.
"But not just push down or slaying by any substance, but respecting the laws"
"observing if there is a reoccuring conflict, or if an intervention is necessary."
"By all means, doing nothing, which was part of some news report is untrue for any case,"
regarding working with the 5 laws of nature.
"What would rather seem to me as inactivity, is when I see an exanthema of the skin,"
"and I give the patient cortisone, and that's it."
"Or I see an inflammation and give the patient antibiotics, and that's it."
This is what I would actually describe as inactivity.
The therapist must even take care of himself as the conversations are often unnerving.
"You have to put yourself in the other's place to grasp his feeling and thinking,"
just as a nurse is used to do.
Example: Rhinitis
"There is always a functional change in every tissue,"
that is unable to fulfil its usual physiological work.
"In the example of rhinits, this is the nasal mucosa whose task is scenting."
"However, running nose and sneezing are symptoms of the repair phase,"
commencing after the resolution of the conflict.
Logic tells us that this is a conflict of scenting.
"In natural life this is about scenting the enemy, the family"
a source of food - to forebode something.
"Man, however, doesn't employ his organ of smell consciously for that purpose any more."
But we still have this interpretation bypassing our intellect.
"For example, in looking for someone, we use our nose,"
even whithout being fully aware of it.
Isolated sneezing comes after the resolution of a short scenting situation (unless there were irritating particles in the nose).
"If rhinitis extends to a longer period of time, we had been unable to scent something for some time."
"What was it I have been afraid of for one moment, it stinks, I'm like an animal in the woods,"
"I smell something which is not good, it's dangerous."
"And when I begin to relax, I get rhinitis."
So these symptoms are always preceded by a resolved scenting conflict.
"This can be, when something is unclear, when we don't know where something or someone is."
"When we don't know what has to be done next, how something works, when something cannot be clearly recognised."
"Also when we are suddenly hustled or otherwise attacked by someone,"
that is not to have scented the enemy in time to prepare against the assault.
Or any other situation we were not able to foresee.
"Also not liking to smell an enemy or a danger. Or simply put - if something ""stinks""."
The Third Biological Law
Some important questions are still left for clarification.
For example why some organs develop hyperplasia in the active phase while others only do so in the repair phase.
"On first encounter, the Third Biological Law may seem to be the most difficult of all, but in essence it is quite simple."
"So don't worry if you don't get it immediately,"
I think this is perfectly normal when hearing for the first time of the entire subject.
"But together with the Second Law, it represents the pivotal element,"
the core structure of the Five Biological Laws as seen from the therapeutical view.
Because an enormous multitude of information can be derived from the Third Biological Law.
Of which this introduction can only provide a gross idea.
"The 3rd law of nature explains basically, that every physiological function of our organism"
"is strictly connected to it's original tissue, developed from the 3 germ layers."
"And that every one of those original tissues is connected to a biological need or necessity,"
meaning a group of typical biological conflicts and a corresponding brain level.
"And it tells us, that every one of those original tissues"
has a specific known behaviour during the phases of a biological program.
fulfill distinct tasks in the organism.
"The inner germ layer, called endoderm, comprises the organs"
responsible for basic life functions.
"They are chiefly occupied with obtaining, processing and deposition of vital substances."
"The endoderm is the oldest of the germ layers and gives rise, inter alia, to the entire gastro-intestinal tract,"
"including the liver, glands and the lungs."
These are organs with resorptive function.
"The lungs resorb oxygen, the liver resorbs food ingredients."
"From the middle germ layer, called mesoderm, all organs arise that provide the body with protection, support and stability,"
"like bones, striated muscles, tendons, corium, connective tissue, intervertebral disks etc."
"The outer germ layer, called ectoderm, comprises, inter alia, all organs of sense,"
"such as the skin, furthermore functions like insuline production ability to smell, to hear."
"All that can be seen of a human from outside, the entire outer skin, is ectoderm."
"Including all nerves and parts of certain tubules, such as the coronary vessels"
or the pancreatic and bile ducts.
"Each of the germ layers is controlled by certain parts of the brain, and here we encounter a specific feature"
"of the middle germ layer wich is divided in two parts, making a total of four types of tissue."
"The brain stem controls the inner germ layer, the endoderm, and thus the basic life functions."
The middle germ layer is party controlled by the cerebellum and partly by the cerebral medulla.
"As the cerebellum is part of the ""old brain"" and the medulla is part of the ""new brain"","
"we speak of ""old brain mesoderm"" and ""new brain mesoderm""."
"The cerebellum controls all parts of the middle germ layer that have a protective function,"
"such as the corium, linings of several organs, sweat glands and mammary glands."
"The medulla controls those parts of the mesoderm which have a protective and enabeling function,"
"like bone, tendons, muscles and connective tissue."
"The outer germ layer, the ectoderm, is controlled by the cerebral cortex."
"Sensation, communication, territory, sexual life"
"In line with this division between new brain and old brain, we observe a fundamental difference"
regarding the patterns of functional change performed by organs in the two phases.
"All organs controlled by the old brain, i. e. the endodermal and old-mesodermal organs,"
develop hyperfunction with subsequent cell proliferation in the sympathicotone conflict active phase.
"In the repair phase starting with resolution of the conflict, surplus tissue is decomposed"
and functions normalise.
"Organs controlled by the new brain, i. e. new-mesoderm and ectoderm,"
develop hypofunction and cell depletion during the active phase.
"During the repair phase, functions are restored and tissue defects restituted."
"However, there is a group of ectodermal Special Programmes,"
effecting merely functional changes with no impact on cell growth or meltdown.
Let's have some examples:
"The pulmonar alveoles are of entodermal origin and controlled by the brainstem, as they are occupied with resorption of vital substances (oxygene)"
and develop hyperfunction and cell proliferation during the conflict active phase.
"After resolution of the conflict, the surplus cells are decomposed and hyperfunction is retracted."
The same is true for the old-brain-mesodermal mammary glands which increase their function and grow in the conflict active phase
and undo both in the repair phase.
A reversal of this order is seen in the organs controlled by the new brain.
"A bone for example, which is part of the new-brain-mesoderm, develops cell defects, so called necroses, in the active phase."
It looses mass and becomes porous and hence more susceptible to fractures.
This is the condition established medicine calls osteoporosis. It is not caused by a wrong diet
"but is a symptom of an active conflict related to the affected bone. We'll have more on this, soon."
"During the repair phase, defects are restituted, which condition is called leukemia,"
"and at a later stage, the bone even develops surplus mass and higher density."
So it is stronger and harder than before.
"Therefore, this group of organs is callel luxus group, showing an improvement after the completion of a Special Programme."
"The skin which is of ectodermal origin, develops superficial cell depletion, a so called ulcus, in the conflict active phase."
The skin becomes flaky and chapped.
"After conflict resolution, the skin is renewed, along with reddening, swelling and itching."
"Most ectodermal organic changes appear as a dilatation of tubes,"
"like the bronchi, arteries, bile and pancreatic ducts, glandular ducts"
of several organs like the lacrimal or thyreoid gland.
"Let's have a closer look on ducts with ectodermal lining, such as the bile ducts."
"The active phase effects a widening of the duct, allowing for more secrete to pass through."
"As indicated already, there is a group of organs in which only a loss of function, without cell depletion, occurs."
"Look, by way of example, at the Programme for the cells occupied with insuline production."
"During the active phase of the conflict which is as conflict of reluctance/resistance or fright/revulsion,"
"insuline production is decreased, and after resolution normalised again."
Without cell depletion or proliferation.
We see that even conditions considered as incurable such as diabetes
"or leukemia, in an earlier example, behave exactly in conformity with the law of the two phases"
and have a limited duration provided the conflict has been resolved.
They don't persist forever but according to the Biological Laws.
"Only medication, such as insuline in this example, made it seem as if these conditions wouldn't cease by themselves,"
as the normal organic insuline production is reduced in the presence of external insuline supply.
"– so we remain addicted to pharmaceutical products, except for the ostensible success"
"of alternative cures like dietary changes, wich is based on a misunderstanding."
"According to the Five Biological Laws, diabetes does not occur incidentically,"
"or as a result of genetical predisposition or a wrong diet, but it is a process"
we undergo on a small scale and with subsequent healing every day.
Many characterisations of these four groups of tissues can be made.
Of great importance as a basic guide is a division by large classes of conflict types.
"Since the biological purpose of endodermal organs is gaining of vital substances,"
we associate the inner germ layer with the so-called morsel conflicts.
"For the wolf, this morsel is his prey, for the child, it might be a toy,"
"for the adult a contract, an asset, money, a house or a car."
"Which organ is addressed, depends precisely from an individual's conception of the morsel."
"When a morsel is strongly desired, it affects the tonsils,"
the salivary glands or adjacent organds.
"When nutritive substances are to be extracted from a morsel like monthly rent from a house,"
this is felt in a digestive organ.
"When a morsel is to be divided in equal pieces, like with a legacy, this could affect the pancreas."
"When a morsel from which no nutrients can be extracted any longer is to be expelled,"
"like a devaluated stock, for example, this would be linked to a more distal part of the bowel."
"The old-brain-mesodermal organs provide protection against traumata, so they are linked to conflicts of assault"
"that man can suffer by besmirching, insults, verbal assaults,"
as opposed to a wildlife animal.
The new-brain-mesodermal organs provide stability and ability to the body
"Accordingly, conflicts linked to them are about not being good or stable enough,"
implicating self-devaluation.
"For example, the knees are associated to athletics involving running, the fingers"
"with skillfulness, the shoulders with holding and embracing as well as being good enough for others."
The skull and the neck are linked to intellectual and moral self esteem.
"Women who are unhappy with their breasts,"
sense this in the vertebral column behind the breasts.
Sexual failure is interpreted with regard to the tailbone.
"Teeth and jaw react to not being able to bite, not being able to crush someone,"
"to defend oneself, to grasp an opportunity, or to bite into something."
"So the specific contents of the conflicts are determined by the functions of each organ, and what purpose"
"each part of the body serves us, bypassing the intellect, only according to our biological determination."
"The more severe the conflict, the harder are the tissues affected."
"So smaller conflicts of self-devaluation affect such tissues as tendons, cartilage, connective tissue, adipose tissue etc."
while severe conflicts of self-devaluation affect bones.
"In each case, there is cellular depletion and necrosis during the conflict active phase,"
and restitution along with pain during the repair phase.
Established medicine often diagnoses the restitutive phase in bones as leukemia.
"The greatest variety of conflict contents is found in the ectodermal group, as it extends to linings"
"of the digestive tract, organs of conscious sense and arbitrary action."
"Here we have conflicts about muscular action, but also consious sensing and touching,"
"view, smell, sound, taste, bringing about sypmtoms like tinnitus, accoustic hallucination, paralysis,"
"myopia, paranoia, clearvoyance, Alzheimer's disease and many others."
"Here is also the wide and important field of territorial conflicts,"
into which subject this documentary cannot go any further due to its complexity.
"Territorial conflicts may result in psychical symptoms like depression, nymphomania,"
"suicidalism, mad shooting, aggression, logorrhoea, obsessive compulsive actions, hysteria, Autism, obsessive anorexia,"
"bulimia, incontinence, out-of-body experiences and developmental retardation in every way."
Case report: osteosarcoma
In the December of 2006 I suddenly developed severe back pain
"along with paroxysm, i. e. the muscles were blocked and I found it difficult to breathe"
When rising up there was such stiffening of my back that I could hardly breathe.
"I took a higher dose of traumadolor, an analgetic and relaxant,"
"and was sleeping for twenty hours. Immediately, I felt better."
"No pain, I was tired, I could sleep. For the time being, everything was all right."
"And as the effect of the drug declined, I became sick. I had to throw up."
The pain came back.
This led me to examining my previously aquired knowledge about New Medicine.
I had first encountered New Medicine in 2005. A friend of mine who had been ill with cancer
"already for many years, had heard about the announcement of a talk by Herr Pilhar."
We had attended it together.
"And as she could exactly track the history of her cancer and all consecutive cancers,"
I was so excited that I enlisted on the spot for further training seminars.
"So now when I did some research, I soon found that my back pain was due to an osteosarcoma and by what conflict it was preceded"
as well as the resolution. It was clear to me what had actually happened.
"In 2006, my company was having a strained time."
A lot of employees were released. I work in the field being in charge of a big area and many clients.
"A complete reform of the area structure was made, posing a great challenge."
This had started early in the the year and became again very acute in July with a new reorganisation.
"This new change was imminant, but yet no one knew how the new allocation map would look like."
"And on the eve before the meeting at which everything was to be announced, after 10 pm, I checked my emails,"
"while working, and I learnt which new area was assigned to me."
I was completely shocked. It really struck me all of a sudden.
I knew I had to go through this on my own. I was afraid to fall ill again and not to stand it.
"Lumbar vertebrae - central self-devaluation - ""My life's achievement is ruined""."
Biologically: The lumbar vertebrae fail to carry the upper part of the body.
"I almost collapsed internally, and already at that moment I said: Now a Special Programme is running."
"From then on, I was working intensely until the end of the year. With great efforts, I was able to get everything done."
There was growing appreciation from my new clients.
"And in the christmas trade, I received a lot of thanks, appreciation and even presents."
"And a few days before Christmas, I was in my living room, saying to myself, quite classically,"
"""Well done! You've finally succeded!"""
"On the next day, the pain came. So I entered the healing phase."
"When the medical expert talked to me, I was already prepared for his diagnosis."
"""There are multiple metastases at different places in the vertebral column."
The MRI reveals shadows that point to metastases.
"A follow-up examination is urgently needed!"""
They wanted to schedule me for scintigraphy and send me to hospital.
"Neither did I try to change his beliefs, nor was I afraid. Actually, I felt sorry for him,"
when he told me all these thing - his diagnosis and prognosis and what has to be done.
"I told him that I have a different view on these things, although I would consider his proposals, but I would definitely not agree to surgery or chemotherapy."
"On the following day, a bombardement with telephone calls started. I was called very often and asked when I would go to hospital."
I was urged to fix a date.
"After several calls I succumbed and made an appointment four weeks later,"
"in order to be left alone, and two days before that date I cancelled and demanded"
not to be called again. I would not come to the hospital.
In the mean time I had a CT scan made without a contrasting agent.
"So, of course, the radiologist asked me why and what for. I just said I need it."
"So, however reluctantly, the CT scan was made."
"Afterwards, he said everything was all right, I only had to wait for him to write down his findings."
"I had demanded not to be given any findings. Eventually, I received everything."
And I wanted to visit Dr. Hamer. I spoke to him once on the telephone.
"We had a deep, honest and encourageing conversation."
"Before we were able to fix a date for a meeting, he went to exile, again."
"Through the few people in New Medicine I knew,"
"I found a therapist in Cologne, and made contact with him."
He asked me for the MRI from the hospital
and for a new CT scan of the affected part of the vertebral column.
"Between the MRI and the meeting with this therapist, four months had passed."
I was able to find a radiological practice where New Medicine is applied.
"There was a long waitlist, I finally got my CT scan in June."
"When I saw the therapist again, finally, it was August."
He confirmed to me that I had completely recovered.
I had often spoken candidly in my company and also in front of my superiors.
"I said that I wouldn't do this and that again, but I continued to do my job day after day."
and I managed to get it done.
"Until I received my clients' thanks, in December, which represented the resolution of the conflict."
I had been receiving these thanks from the beginning of December - but I didn't notice it consciously or unconsciously.
the crucial moment was the situatioin which I remember exactly:
"When I patted myself on the back and said: You did it well, you succeeded!"
"On the following day, the pain came, and fiercely at that."
"I was completely unaffected by the expert diagnosis in the hospital,"
I was always feeling grateful that I had encountered New Medicine.
The confirmation by the therapist was just another proof that it is correct.
And I am simply convinced of this. In my case it proofed correct.
"I have been able to track it in a lot of cases, as well as in my family,"
in minor health problems or major ones. I can verify it every day.
"And even when diseases occur in my clients, including severe cases of cancer,"
"I can always confirm that the problems, the conflicts and the type of cancer"
as well as the course match 100% with New Medicine.
The Fourth Biological Law
"Now, naturally, the question arises what contagiousness and infections are all about."
"Because, if all Special Programmes are initiated by a biological impulse, or a DHS,"
the old assumptions with regard to the causes cannot hold true.
"Based on the established concept of disease, it was always easy to find something that made you ill."
"We are saying: I picked it up, I got infected."
"Or when we were in the cold, or outside with wet hair, or met by an air draught."
Or one of the favourites: The weather.
"So you can always find something to be held responsible, but there can be no certainty."
The story with the microbes is a little harder to explain
because their role is strongly predefined in the minds of most people.
"If you tell people, that microorganisms might possibly not play the role they were told, they will resist that."
is met by various resistance.
"This takes us to the Fourth Biological Law,"
which contrasts most sharply with all our old beliefs.
It has been observed that all conditions we used to regard as infectious diseases
are in fact symptoms appearing in the repair phase.
"These comprise various forms of coughing, coryza, the so called cervical cancer of the uterus,"
"exanthemas, tuberculosis, herpes, various so called veneral diseases, athlete's foot and others."
"But all of these, and many, many others, are ALWAYS preceded by a conflict active phase"
"which had however escaped our notion, showing no symptoms in most cases."
And as these symptoms appear only after a conflict resolution and together with vagotone phenomena
"like fatigue and fever, they cannot represent active phases of disease or infection, as was previously assumed."
"The microbes (funghi, mycobacteria, tuberculi, bacteria and disputably viruses)"
are indeed observed during these processes.
"It follows, however, that they cannot have caused their initiation, but, if anything, HELP in these repair processes."
"Let's call the bacteria firefighters and the disease the fire, then we could say:"
"Whenever I come along a burning house, I also see the firefighters in front of it. How puzzeling!"
"Hence, statistically speaking, the firefighters seem to be responsible for the fire."
Apply this logics to bacteria. Why is the cause of diseases thought to be precisely in bacteria?
"Only, because in examining the disease, I will find bacteria."
This has often puzzled me. There is no proof.
We could also make the statisictal finding that all people who are ill have drunken water.
"So water should be regarded the main cause, or not?"
"Of course, the observations of the micro organisms,that are made by the established medicine,"
"as they show up during the symptomatic phase, they are true."
"From a scientific view, regarding the 5 laws of nature, these germs are not the cause"
but a part of the whole process.
They practically show up with the symptoms and disappear with the symptoms disappearing.
"This is not the result of, for example, antibiotics, as it was thought."
They (antibiotics) will only slow down or stop the process.
"And as soon as their effect passes, both, symptoms and germs, will show up again."
"After what we know today, antibiotics work on the brain level."
"Actually, by the effect, that the activity of germs is present during the symptomatic phase, during regeneration"
"during the vagotonic curve, the antibiotics affect the autonomous nervous system by creating a little more sympathicotonia."
An artificial stress. An artificial physiological stress.
...which reduces the symptoms and stops the activity of the germs.
And here is what the Fourth Biological Law states.
"Funghi, Mycobacteria and Tuberculi are helpers in the repair phase of tissues controlled by the old-brain."
Bacteria and disputably viruses unfold their activity - if anything - in the repair phase of tissues controlled by the new-brain.
"We may regard these ultrasmall creatures, funghi, mycobacteria, bacteria and viruses - as far as they exist -"
as micro-surgeons whose service becomes necessary in the healing phase.
"So for example, an adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland which can emerge and grow after a caring/quarreling conflict"
is decomposed by mycobacteria after the resolution of the conflict.
"During the conflict active phase, these mycobacteria had proliferated at the same rate as the tumor."
"So at the time of the conflict resolution, I bear an amount of mycobacteria, corresponding to the mass of the tumour,"
"now they quickly transfer this tumour into one with pus inside so that it can be digested,"
"during which process it sometimes erupts through the skin, and develeops into a perfect citratice,"
provided these bacteria had been in place from the very beginning.
"It might be dangerous within the digestive system, if a person has a huge"
"tissue process there, and it cannot be reduced during reparation phase,"
this might lead to an intestinal blockage
"An ileus, a mechanic blockage."
In such a case a surgical intervention is necessary. If the corresponding bacteria
"or fungia are present, they could help reduce the tissue in a natural way,"
renormalizing the situation without external influence.
So these germs are symbionts aiding us.
They are living in us helping the optimization of the reparation process.
"If we look at the illness only in a symptomatic view, we might see these germs as a cause."
"And this is a development of the old believe of war and destruction within the organism, from the believe of immune system,"
that there is an army and that there are enemies that need to be fought.
"Once we understood the 5 laws of nature, we will understand, that these germs have not been the enemy, but only co-workers during a biological process."
"When any studies are conducted under established medicine, the truth is observed, necessarily."
"However, what they make out of it often arouses our amusement."
"I think last year, there was a remarkable study:"
A German medical scientist examined cases of spontaneous cancer remission and observed
that all spontaneous remissions coincided with febrile infections.
which is of course clear according to the Biological Laws.
"Decomposition of cancers takes place in the healing phase,"
when there is also fever along with the so-called infectious diseases.
"We also know that microbes take part in this, etc."
But what have they made out of it?
They think the high temperature caused by the fever would burn the cancer cells or sort of.
So everything is trimmed to fit into the struggle they want to see.
For the tissues controlled by younger brain levels we do not know the germs as a necessary element
for a reparation but as enhancers.
"We do not know what is going on, if the bacteria are not present when a muscle or a bone repairs."
Nonetheless there is a reparation and scarification.
They are only necessary for a smooth reparation in the tissues of the old brain parts.
So the tissue controlled by brain stem and cerebellum.
"But of course, science never stops, and there is a need to discover more."
Maybe the role in the new brain part tissue is misunderstood.
"The theory of bacteria invading us and causing the disease becomes all together invalid at a time,"
"when I consider that when I have a sore throat, but neither coryza,"
"nor sinusitis, only a little pain in my throat,"
although the same bacteria go everywhere. But I have it only at this place
- as this zone is currently in the healing phase.
We have to awake from our hypnosis of the evil beast
that tries to devour us or the evil microbes causing damage in us.
"If we look at it from a disinterested scientific viewpoint, everyone, and physicists and scientists in the first place,"
will exactly figure out what actually happens there.
"But what about epidemics, mass disease and alleged contagion?"
"When a group of people suffer the same kind of conflict because they receive the same impressions,"
"they will after joint resolution of the conflict ""become ill"" in similar ways."
"1st ""disease"" ""contagion""?? ""got infected, too""??"
"This phenomenon has become all the more common in modern times,"
as the mass media induce synchronised perception.
Another example is a school class where students are often jointly exposed to the same conflict.
like a unexpectedly difficult class test or the absence of a dear teacher
who is replaced by a much disliked terrible teacher.
"After resolving their conflicts, the students one after the other enter the healing phase"
and claim to have got infected from each other.
"in every case when members of our household had any symptoms at the same time, everyone was able"
to track his symptoms back to a specific conflict and its resolution exactly according to the Biological Laws.
The fact is remarkable that the symptoms are almost never exactly the same.
"So when people allegedly ""infect"" each other, they do have different symptoms after all."
So it's necessary to analyse every single symptom of every person in accordance with New Medicine.
"Unti now, I have always found the relations in full accordance with New Medicine"
and no trace of an infection.
"Many epidemics, like the plague for example, must be regarded as the result of intoxination"
brought about by disastrous hygienic conditions. Especially when combined with medicine
"containing mercury, poisoning and death may result."
These conditions inevitably cause many additional conflicts
such as fear of death leading to lung symptoms previously described
or conflicts of besmirching leading to the so called bubonic plague - and many others.
"At this point, the Spanish Flu or other alleged epidemics are often invoked."
As this subject would boost the time frame of this production
"because the problem of infection would have to be dealt with in feature-length alone,"
"we may recommend here Michael Leitners documentary ""H5N1 antwortet nicht"" available on the internet."
"This is skeptical of the infection theory, but not grounded on knowledge of the Five Biological Laws,"
but on the established concept of disease.
Many other pieces on this subject can be found on www.klein-klein-media.de for free.
Vaccination according to New Medicine
What are vaccinations all about?
"Vaccination is, at first, creation of fear."
From a view of the 5 laws of nature vaccination does not have a preventive of curative effect.
First of all it is an articial poisoning and a retaining of fear.
"The support of the old belief of an enemy, nature that attacks me."
"According to ""new medicine"" this is a critical thing,"
because this belief is a strong foundation for follow up conflicts.
"On the other hand, if someone needs a pseudo vaccination"
"for calming down, this might be useful."
The chemical contents of vaccinations are just toxic.
"If the earth is not a disc, we don't need to think about a fence on the border"
in order to prevent someone from falling off.
Special Programmes are biologically indispensible and cannot
be suppressed with some sort of vaccination. And why would we want to?
Even if it was possible it would be detrimental to do so because the Special Programmes help me get through the situation.
"Mind you, of course, not to confuse this with the symptoms of the healing phase coming only after a conflict resolution."
"With medical knowledge, vaccination can only be termed criminal."
Because it is impossible. Toxic agents are administered without any possibility
of yielding any positive effect.
"A depot of nerve, muscle or reproductive toxines is induced into the body along with the claim"
that it could protect against a ficticious infectious agent by provoking a reaction of a fictitious immune system.
"In theory there are vaccination damages that are solely chemical, bio-chemical."
So just plain poisoning by the vaccination.
"But I believe we need to differentiate. Because a lot of the anti-vaccination discussion,"
that is arguing about vaccination damages does not know or regard the 5 laws of nature.
So if 1000 people are vaccinated and only 2 of them show specific symptoms
"it might be, that it is not the biochemical factors, that are the cause for these symptoms."
"And of course, the process of vaccination might cause a strong biological conflict for the child."
"Just imagine, your own mother, in most of the cases, takes you to the doctor, a stranger,"
"who is hurting you, and sometimes you are even restrained by the own mother"
so that the stranger can hurt you.
This is not a very good thing for the child and contains a lot of conflict potential.
And a lot of things could happen here. Things affecting the motoric system or the skin.
"Like separation, the wish to get out of this situation."
"From knowing ""new medicine"" we need to look at that a little more distant."
"But of course, every application of an unknown chemical substance"
within our body is a little poisoning.
If there are symptoms or not in the end depends on the intensity.
"I don't want to go into it too far, because this whole chapter about the immune system and vaccinations is based entirely on non-facts."
And I cannot have a discussion about non-facts.
There is no record showing which agent causes which disease.
There is no proof for example for the existence of viruses.
We have never seen the immune system.
"What they call the immune system are subfamilies of leukocytes,"
helpers and suppressors etc. but this is built merely on ideas.
These are not facts. It cannot be discussed.
It is like having a discussion with someone who believes the earth is flat.
What could I say to him?
"I can only say, one day, when you awake from this hypnosis,"
"you will realise that there is no ""immune system""."
There are many self-regulating systems in the organism.
"There are many responses from different tissues with different types of cells, like leukocytes, enzymes or antibodies."
"There is a constant regulation, but there is no ""immune system""."
There are efficient responses to situations we have to cope with.
But there is no immune system. And for vaccination there is absolutely no proof.
My children have never been vaccinated. They are 17 and 18 and in perfect health.
"They didn't get any vaccination. Of course, I have never been afraid."
"If I would have been afraid, everything would have been worse. I would have been afraid"
that I made a mistake in omitting to vaccinate.
"Now, when my child is coughing a little bit, hell breaks loose."
"When I succeed to escape this superstition and hypnosis, these non-facts,"
than I can take the decision for or against vaccination in a much relaxed way.
Then no one can make me get vaccinated - what for?
"But this supersition has been spread by the media decades ago,"
and has been implanted in the people's marrow.
"And now we need to come back to normal, generation after generation."
It will take its time.
"What is done since discovery of germs with the help of the microscope is,"
that all this movement is seen as a war.
"And since Louis Pasteur assumed, that there is a war happening, this is seen wherever we look."
And now we see those elements being active or not in the blood
and we see them as an intra-organic-special-forces-unit
fighting enemy bacteria and pushing forward the war.
"Viewed from the 5 laws of nature all those cells and elements, they all do have a function."
"But this function does not involve fighting a war, but as a self regulation."
"Like cleaning up cell material, that is left from a biological program."
"Regarding that, there is no immune system, as we believe to be"
"like an army at warfare, that is protecting us."
"But there is a system, a system of self regulation, a cleaning team, that is maintaining everything."
"And these are those cells, however we call them."
"Those who carry out, those who propagate and those who produce vaccinations"
have not yet offered any proof for the usefulness of vaccinations.
"In place of such a proof, there are only statistics. Statisitics on vaccination usually look like this:"
The red line represents the number of deaths in a specific disease.
"At this point, vaccination was introduced."
Here it is obvious that there is no causal connection between the vaccination and the regression of the disease.
Another type of statistics is this:
"The time befor the introduction of the vaccine is simply not shown,"
so what was seen in the previous chart is invisible.
And this is the fact that the regression of the disease had started long before the introduction of the vaccine.
"However, the most interesting statistical method is this:"
It requires a lot of research to uncover what is actually behind this ostensibly successful vaccination.
"It was done in the case of polio, for example. The trick is to change the definition of the disease or the obligation to report it to the authorities."
So from the moment of the introduction of the vaccine there is an entirely new characterisation of the respective disease.
Symptoms previously associated whit polio are nowdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis
or other diseases and where not reported as cases of polio
and don't enter the statistics any more.
Another way is to waver the obligation to report the disease
so that it doesn't appear in the statistics anymore ore only with a number near zero.
"Or doctors simply diagnose something else, because it's impossible"
that the patient suffers from the disease he is vaccinated against.
And this disease against which has been vaccinated disappears from the records.
only to remain there under a new name.
They constantly instigate our fear with the alleged numbers of thousands of deaths caused by flu.
A closer look on the origins of this number reveals - it doesn't exist.
The Robert-Koch-Institut (which draws up these numbers) will confirm how it is done:
"They look at the numbers of deaths in summer and then in winter, the latter always being a little higher,"
they take the difference - and this is the number of flu deaths.
They assume that this can only be explained by infections.
While even the number of traffic accidents in the winter can be so much higher that there are significantly more deaths.
"I won't have myself vaccinated, and although I had my children vaccinated according to my previous knowledge,"
I wouldn't do it anymore. That is my personal opinion.
I won't vaccinate neither myself nor my children in the future.
"""I don't know If I have not made a terrible mistake"
"and created something ingenious."" Edward Jenner, first vaccine inventor"
But what about AIDS? Everybody talks about it. Is it possible that this is a great bad joke?
What we know as AIDS doesn't exist. The hypothetic HI virus doesn't cause AIDS.
"And the diseases summarised under this ""Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"" have nothing to do"
with the immune system which doesn't really exist as what it had been considered previously.
"AIDS is a pool of arbitrarily chosen diseases, and they are different for each part of the world."
They even include herpes.
And how about the people in Africa?
"They have all sorts of diseases which are declared ""AIDS"". It's just arbitrary."
They are not even tested for HIV. When they have a running nose they have AIDS.
About AIDS there is hope. You're going to hear about that tonight.
"Ms. Papagiannidou, journalist, is a former AIDS patient and says openly."
"She will speak about her fight and will offer what I told you earlier, hope."
"However I had full blown AIDS for 12 years, suffered all kind of illnesses,"
Went back and forth to the outside world and now I'm in perfect health without doctors or AIDS drugs.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, here is Mrs. Papagiannidou's husband."
Three years married. He certainly knows that there is an issue.
How did he face it? Let's ask him.
"I've been studying this subject matter since 1984, and I know that being positive does not mean"
that you are sick or that there is a virus.
So I knew that she had nothing.
Gilles presented to me the other side of AIDS
in 2006. It was an even bigger shock to me to learn that there was another view about AIDS
after all I suffered during those hard years.
Gilles showed to me that the test I had taken does not detect HIV virus because the HIV virus has never been found anywhere.
Here is the test kit package insert from Abbott Laboratories. Dr. Gallo together with Abbott made the antibodies test.
"This test, as much as any other test used for that purpose, claim on their insert which is never showed to us -"
At present there is no recognised standard for establishing the presence and absence
of HIV-1 antibody in human blood.
It is written by the makers. This insert is never shown to anyone.
"When you ask the doctors to show it, they say it is prohibited by the government."
As for the health ministry I have sent them an official request two years ago.
"asking them to present us the proofs, when was the virus isolated? Where is the scientific experiment proving the existence of HIV"
and that such entity can cause the death of immune cells?
I'd like to present to you evidence of scientific fraud. - You say that there is a scientific fraud about AIDS.
He crossed whatever he did not like and nowhere is there any proof given.
"Here it says: ""Despit intensive research efforts the causative agent of AIDS has not yet been identified."""
"He erased those two lines and sent the paper to be published in the ""Science"" magazine."
I would like to say that I'm not an exceptional or a rare case. I'm only different because I speak publicly.
There are thousands like me all over the world who have quit the medication.
Why do you come out and speak publicly? I find it very daring and courageous.
"But since that documentation fell into my hands, I could not stay silent."
You say to yourself: That's not possible and want to discuss it with others - we ar humans.
Should I keep that evidence only for me at home?
The AIDS doctors mostly appy the AIDS protocols which was proved to be faulty.
"Since I knew that I have no health problem, all evidence ascertains that, we would like, with my husband, to have a child."
"If I do so, because I was found positive once, with a test that does not detect the virus, and there is the relevant documentation,"
that AIDS protocol dictates that AZT should be given to my baby for fourty days.
"AIDS patient are prescribed, amon others, the drug AZT."
"which, unfortunately, is highly toxic and bears a skull on the package."
A decisive death factor is the doctor's diagnosis along with the prognosis
"the patient is turned to perpetual conflict acitivity, he cannot recreate and will emaciate."
"With your husband, do you have normal sexual contacts?"
Absolutely normal. . Without condom?
"No condom at all, because we know with AIDS, if you are well informed, you live, if you don't, you die. so get informed. Doctor, tell us about that."
And she tells us... Since when have you been infected?
"Since 1985. Virtually, since the beginning of AIDS. My story coincides with it."
"1985, that is 24 years ago since she was infected by the AIDS virus."
"Veryfied through exams: Yes, you are positive, yes, you went ill."
"But she is alive, married for three years now, she has normal sexual contacts with her husband who has not become infected."
She says: I'm living. I'm doing fine.
"If the health ministry does not show us the proofs of isolation of that virus, it can't give mandatory treatment to newborn babies."
It won't give mandatory treatment to my baby for something that is not proven to exist.
It is now crucial to verify if you have really infected someone with the virus or not.
Have any criminal or medical examinations been done so far in that respect?
"Unfortunately, I am not allowed to talk about this."
"Of course, some things have been initiated, but I will readily disclose them"
only at the appropriate time.
We have sought some information about the medical scientific view on this:
"After many years - especially under appropriate medical treatment,"
"this verification is very difficult and actually downright impossible to obtain, according to experts."
"""This verification is very difficult and actually downright impossible to obtain."""
"Of course, I always recommend to ask for proofs in order to get certainty, unless you are already firm."
"When I know for sure, for example thanks to New Medicine, that it just cannot be like that,"
"because I have verified Hamer's discoveries and confirmed them,"
so that there is no space for any exogenous infectious agent
"coming accidentally from the outside,"
"then it may be reasonable to ask for proofs, in order to reassure yourself of the truth and become more self-confident."
When it comes to the existence of viruses I can say that I followed that course:
I have questioned the Robert-Koch-Institut - I got nothing.
I have questioned my health insurance agency -i didn't get any publication.
"I followed that course, and I would encourage others to do the same."
It is quite simple. You only need to ask:
"Where is a scientific publication demonstrating the discovery and isolation, i. e. the proof"
"of any virus allegedly causing disease - measles, HIV, pox, flu - where has it been proven?"
And they have nothing to offer in this regard.
"They cannot give you anything, because in the publications to which they refer internally,"
"And then they say there must be a virus inside, because, the animal"
I have given an injection or the cell culture
"I have ceased to supply or even intoxicated, have died - so there must be a virus."
"And of course, they won't disclose this adulteration, the are ashamed of it, because"
there is already so much information out in the public - and so they won't single out any specific publication.
"They say: There are entire libraries full of publications, and it's a consensus,"
and we cannot go through thousands of publications.
"And in the sum of these thousands of publications we would have to provide,"
"somewhere in their sum, the proof is hidden - probably between the commas."
And this is easy to verify for everyone. I always show my own publications
and what marks a scientific publication:
"The date of the publication, the date when the manuscript was submitted, then in the meantime it was reviewd and then accepted for publication."
"Unless these two dates appear on the paper, it is not an original scientific work."
"Then it is some essay or second hand literature,"
"in place of which you could just as well have a porn collection sent to you,"
and you will have more fun with it.
"By chance, you'll even find some isolated things on it."
But everything they used to send earlier showed nothing of that sort.
"And this means that we have left the stage where it was possible,"
"as a member of parliament, to play stupid:"
"Oh, I have no understanding of this, I have studied law, or economic dumb science,"
"but biology, medicine, this is only for experts."
No. It has by now become so easy to verify
and to explicate that there can be no excuse anymore.
The head of the German health agency Ulla Schmidt wrote on 5 January 2004:
"""Of course, the Humane Immunodeficiency Virus is considered to be"
"But ""considered to be"" is not ""is"". And: A ""consensus"" cannot be photographed!"
Google: HIV-Isolation
What can be seen in those pictures that were disclosed earlier
and still circulate on the internet?
"If it is a transversal section of the cell, everyone can recognise that it shows nothing but cellular elements"
"i. e. mitochondria cut at the apex, so these are the compartiments"
employed by the cell to conduct internal and external transport.
"Die sind in diesem Größenbereich, sehen aber alle unterschiedlich groß aus, sind natürlich auch nicht dafür gemacht,"
"den ganzen Zellverbund zu verlassen und sind deswegen nicht stabil, haben nicht immer das gleiche Aussehen,"
haben (((nicht - eine Nukleinsäure beinhaltet das nicht))) was ich durch einfachste Färbetechniken schon darstellen kann.
A different way to produce those particles to be presented as viruses
"is to create an ordinary emulsion of proteines, fat and water."
Than small particles develop - like in soap - which have to be fixated chemically
"or even frozen, so that it is possible to take a photograph of them."
But even in this case you can see that they are all of different size
and that any biochemical analysis is lacking.
This is logical. To isolate these particles
and make a biochemical analysis of their composition - is simply not done.
And it is not required - They just give you an isolated picture as proof for something.
And this is already an attempt to fraud.
This is clear evidence of fraud: On demanding a scientific publication
you are shown an isolated picture.
This is a real brazenness to present
"an isolated photograph, without any exlpanation"
"as to how it was obtained and what has been done there - to present this as proof for something, all the more after being asked"
for a scientific publication - this is a common attempt to deceit.
As to this short video sequence which is claimed
to show the birth of HIV. This is simply brazen.
They claim that a cell was given genetical information necessary to produce a proteine
"which is attributed to HIV but allegedly being only some part of HIV, the cell seemingly"
"produced and expelled this proteine, seen as little particles on its surface,"
which can be made visible using fluorescence microscopy
"as lightning or, through staining agents, coloured."
"The original publication clearly states: ""these are virus like particles""."
so this is merely a model.
While the very same scientis in the media claimed that it is HIV.
"Reading the original publications, you realise what brazen and shameless liars they are."
But why would we? Reading the manual? What for?
The few who do so will of course leave the job.
Or those who begin to question already during their studies: What are we measuring here?
"How can we have obtained, after 20 measurements, 10 positive and 10 negative results?"
Why is this fact ignored in the disussions? That's how it really looks like.
"For this reason, no AIDS or cancer researcher will be able to step back and have a different look on the conditions."
It is instead presupposed that these conditions have to be fought against.
research is based on this dogma and paradigm and has therefore arrived at a dead end.
"In every observation, this dogmatic concept of disease is invoked."
Goethe - in vein - has posed a warning to us 200 years ago in Faust I:
"""This was the medicine—the patients' woes soon ended,And none demanded: who got well? Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,"
"Among these vales and hills surrounding, Worse than the pestilence, have passed. Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;"
"And I must hear, by all the living, The shameless murderers praised at last!"" (FROM BAYARD TAYLOR'S TRANSLATION)"
I'm still keeping contact to some of my former colleagues.
"Just recently I had a conversation with one of them, who had tried last year to enlighten me about measles."
(which issue was quickly settled). Now recently he came up with tetanus.
I just looked at him and said: You hold a doctor's degree in chemistry.
You should be aware of the fact that the tetanus bacterium
"just like all other bacteria, can produce toxines only in the absence of oxygene."
He looked at me and said: Of course. It's anaerobic.
Upon which I noted:
"Presumably you are not interested in learning more details about this issue and New Medicine in general,"
because if so you would neither want nor be able to work for the drug industry any longer.
"No, they don't know better. They are all believers. I used to believe it myself."
"That you always need ACE to lower the blood pressure, and things like this, I used to believe all of it."
"Only in 2000, I myself had all vaccinations refreshed for the last time."
I think it's a problem of medical education. There's too much theory and far too little practice.
And learning consists of dull memorising.
"It wouldn't satisfy me. In the end, you have: If someone has a cold"
"he's given antibiotics, if someone has hypertension, he's given beta blockers."
"Always according to the book. If someone has an exanthema, he's given cortisone, etc."
It doesn't require much consideration.
This enables them to process a lot of patients. So I think it's also an economic issue.
Two phases on three levels
"Understanding which processes the three levels brain, organ and psyche ungdergo during the two phases, is of high importance."
Starting with the DHS which represents a conflict between perceived reality
"and biological needs, all three levels are turned to sympathicotonia."
A meaningful biological Special Programme begins.
The brain relay responsible for each biological need
"as well as the corresponding organs and conscious actions, develops a hyperfunction."
"In the Brain CT scan, we see a Hamer Focus."
"On the psychical level, there is compulsive dwelling over the conflict, not leaving any space for other thoughts,"
"until the conflict is resolved or becomes obsolete. We cannot sleep during nights, as the resolving of the problem has top priority."
"On the organic level, there are general symptoms like stenosis of blood vessels or release of stress hormones."
"We are anorectic, as the mouse, to stick to our example, wouldn't take up food while running away."
"And in the specific organ affected, sympathicotonia, depending on the type of tissue, would result"
in hypofunction or hyperfunction according to the Third Law.
"It is also worth mentioning that a Hamer Focus can be seen on a CT scan of the affected organ, too."
"Provided that the conflict becomes resolved or obsolete, all three levels enter the repair phase."
"The word repair phase might suggest that everything is over, but it may become dangerous,"
especially due to the cerebral process.
"This repair phase A (also called post-conflictolysis A, pcl A) is the edematous phase."
"The brain relay, now without a Hamer Focus, stores water."
"Which results in swelling. It was precisely this condition previously described as a brain tumor,"
"which is correct, as tumor refers merely to a tissue expansion."
What's wrong is the assumtion that this is caused by a malignant and never ending process.
"However, a possible danger arises only from the dimension and position of this temporary tumor."
"On the psychic level, the phase after conflict resolution is characterised by disengagement,"
and we are able to relax and read a book if we wish so.
"In the organ, there is also swelling due to water storage."
"Both swelling processes, depending on which neighbouring tissues they exert pressure on, can cause pain and other symptoms,"
for example due to obstruction of nerves and tubes or sqeezing of other brain areas.
Nearly all sorts of pain and impairment not caused by trauma
appear due to swelling in this repair phase A.
"General organic symptoms of the conflict active phase, like elevated release of stress hormones"
"or stenosis of vessels, are temporarily turned to their opposites"
and slowly normalise until the end of the entire process.
"Therefore, we tend to have warm hands during the repair phase."
The swelling of the brain relay regularly causes hypofunction
or even complete dysfunction of the organ it controls.
"Parkinson's disease, paralysis of a bowel segment or anaesthesia of the skin are examples"
for hypofunction caused by brain edema.
"Psyche: Disengagement, relaxation Brain: swelling of the specific relay Organ: swelling"
This repair phase A persists for a maximum of three weeks.
Provided the conflict is not constantly reactivated.
in wich case the repair phase has to begin anew each time.
"A typical situation is having trouble at the worklplace with colleagues or the boss,"
or anything else - then you are conflict active while on the job - and disengaged when coming home
"where you develop healing symptoms, when you go to work again, you become again conflict active."
So the whole thing keeps constantly rolling back and forth.
"After this maximum of three weeks, the cerebral and organic edemae are sqeezed out."
This is a single moment of sympathicotonia.
"And due to the interrelation of the three levels, conflict activity returns on the psychic level as well for the duration of this so called epicrisis."
"Suddenly, the conflict already resolved for some time, seizes our mind again."
"and is, with Dr. Hamer's words, experienced for a second time in time-lapse mode."
The word epicrisis has a twofold meaning. On the one hand it means - quite conveniently - final report.
On the other hand it is an acronyme of epileptic or epileptoid crisis describing the symptoms of this stage.
We experience this seizure as which the epicrisis on the brain level appears many times every day.
In extensive swellings this may become dangerous
and requires medication or other measures.
"According to this novel knowledge, medication can be started at the right time,"
"as the epicrisis does no longer come as a surprise,"
but experienced therapists are able to predict its day and hour exactly.
"On the organic level, the epicrisis adopts very specific forms, depending on the organ and type of tissue."
"These crises may appear as epileptic seizures, syncope, colics, sneezing, different types of heart attacks,"
"asthma, panic and many others like birth or orgasm,"
"these latter two being also part of significant Biological Special Programmes,"
abiding by these Five Biological Laws.
The duration of the epicrisis differs between all four types of tissue.
"In the ectoderm, there is a regular maximal duration of 20 seconds, which can however be prolongated by tensing up."
For example if you try to push back muscular paroxysm instead of relaxing.
"In this diagramme, there is only one epicrisis, but there may be several in succession."
"This is because during the epicrisis, the edematous brain relay is squeezed out."
"If this is not accomplished with a single epicrisis, several trials are taken, for example, when we have to sneeze repeatedly."
The liquid from the swellings is peed out during the transition to repair phase B.
We call this the peeing phase.
"During pcl B, the normal state is restored. The severe symptoms of pcl A are left behind."
Cicatrisation is now observed both in the brain and the organ.
"Connective tissue, stemming from the middle germ layer, immigrates."
"When a Special Programme often repeats this repair phase B, the affected tissue will be mixed with new scar tissue each time,"
"which was previously diagnosed as de-differentiated tissue,"
"because due to the mixing with connective tissue, it couldn't be regognised as stemming from one germ layer."
Some organs develep cysts providing for a lasting hyperfunction.
"For example, an ovarian cyst makes a woman look ten years younger permanently."
So it needs not to be removed for its assumed malignancy.
"If in old-brain tissues, the microbes necessary for the decomposition of tumors are lacking,"
the tumors are encapsulated in this phase.
So they remain forever. Frequently running Programmes leave chalk residues from pcl B.
"Previously calcified shoulders or arteries were attributed to an allegedly wrong diet,"
but they are the result of processes that have often become necessary in a person's life.
"These cicatrisations, cystifications, densifications and encapsulations"
are the remaining final states of Special Programmes.
"The vast majority of them won't be ever noticed, but in the eye or bone, for example,"
"these remaining scars can pose a lasting impairment,"
"for which reason one should try to prevent the Special Programmes from becoming necessary again, if possible."
"""The greatest mistake in the treatment of diseases is that there are physicians for the body and physicians for the soul,"
"although the two cannot be separated."" Plato, 427-347 BC."
Here is the entire process at a glance:
"During the conflict active phase, activity of the affected brain area is observed – in the psyche: compulsive dwelling over"
and searching for a resolution of the conflict – at the organ a specific sympathicontonic symptom.
"After conflict resolution, during pcl A, there is swelling of the brain area and the organ, resulting in hypofunction"
"or complete dysfunction, or pain or other symptoms"
caused directly by the mechanical pressure.
"At the same time, cell proliferation or depletion resulting from the active phase are undone."
The psyche is disengaged and relaxed.
"During the epicrisis, the swellings are squeezed and subsequently peed out."
"The symptoms of which are very specific both on the organ as on the psychic level,"
"but always presenting as greatly exacerbated conflict activity,"
so the active phase is experienced for a second time in time-lapse mode.
"During pcl B, the normal state is slowly restored – accompanied by the same, if weaker symptoms of pcl A."
"In the brain and at the organ, there is cicatrisation, at the organ there may be cystification,"
encapsulation or densification which result in lasting final states.
"All symptoms not obviously caused by trauma, intoxication or, perhaps, malnutrition,"
can be tracked according to this pattern.
The principal question is which tissue is affected and what is the current phase.
The cause for the starting of the Prorgammes can among other things be seen from the function of the affected organ.
"""cervical cancer of the uterus"", leukemia, aching bones, panic, swollen tonsils, gastric pain,"
"diabetes - glucagone deficiency - ""hypoglucemia"" ""hyperglucemia"" ""severe hypoglucemia"", bronchial cancer,"
"pimples, suicide (attacker), acoustic hallucination, ""bladder inflammation"", hypothyreosis, alopecia,"
"tooth pain, median otitis, paralysis, Parkinson's disease, ""skin cancer"","

Basically there are three different ways of how to realize being ill.
"First is having a corporal sign like a redden skin. Second one is having a symptom, like itching"
"or a pain. And third that you are told by someone, based on different parameters and opinions."
"From the view of the ""new medicine"", we always need to ask, what is it, that this person really has?"
In established medicine today we have strong labelization of illness.
It's like there are different containers and every container is a specific label of disease
and contains a lot of different elements.
"And as for fuzzy terms like multiple sclerosis, of which there is an infinite number,"
they don't rest on permissable definitions.
Have a look on Wikipedia to learn which symptoms are listed under these namings.
Often there is a list of 20 symptoms or even more.
"So if there are 5 people with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, it might be,"
"that symptom wise they are totally different,"
only having the same diagnosis. Coming from the 5 laws of nature this way to work is hardly possible.
"Coming from the ""new medicine"" it is always important to see, what is really there."
"But if you disentangle the symptoms and analyse them seperately according to New Medicine, everything becomes clear."
"Which germ layer, which tissue type in which phase?"
"Then we know immediately what kind of conflict, what interpretation of conflict in which phase is present for this person,"
and why this person experienced a conflict like that or why he/she does not get out of the situation
keeping the process reoccuring. This is always an individual matter for every person.
"So there is no ""multiple sclerosis"" with a thousand symptoms which may be brought about by this or that."
There are merely specific Special Programmes each of which is triggered precisely by one conflict matter.
"Among these specific Special Programmes, there is one, however, which exerts great influence on all other Programmes."
"The kidney's collecting tubules The renal collecting tubules stem from the endoderm,"
their task is reabsorbation of water.
"Of 120 liters circulating through the kidneys everyday, 99% are kept"
and 1% is passed through and peed out.
"Of course, we don't hold 120 liters, but our blood is circulated through the kidneys all the time,"
and this ammounts to 120 liters per day.
"Normally, from these 120 liters, 1% is filtered out. So we should pee 1.2 liters per day."
"However, when storing water becomes biologically necessary, reabsorbation is intensified."
"This may be the case when one hast lost his safe haven, a place where he had felt at home and secure."
"The loss of this ""safe haven"" is biologically interpreted"
like ending up in the desert or when a fish has been swept onto the dry bank.
"Also a loved partner or, in small children, the mother may represent such a safe haven."
"The conflict is also described as ""feeling like a motherless child"", „feeling badly cared for“,"
"or as an ""existential conflict"" or ""refugee conflict""."
Its biological essence is however unambigous: An oasis providing full security
- the specific meaning of this remaining subject to everyone's determination - is lost with nowhere else to go.
The result is water storage due to an increased reabsorbation
which protects from dehydration.
Nature doesnt no of our modern technology of water supply and that we are not at risk of dehydration.
The Special Programme has originated at some point in the evolution of species and disregards our cultural exploits.
"Previously, the condition was consideres as renal insufficiency, for the poor excretion of water,"
when this is quite to the contrary brought about by hyperfunction of the collecting tubules.
"During the active phase, the water may be stored in the adipose"
"or connective tissue, resultin in a constant gain of weight."
This obesity has nothing to do with a wrong diet.
Dr. Hamer even says that 90% of all adipose people
"are active ""refugees"" and store water."
There was a lot of talking about the fat junk food eaters in the US. Perhaps the cause of their obesity
can be found in a society where fear of the future is a normal condition.
causing the organism to store all nutritive elements available as reserves.
"According to the three level synchronicity, the corresponding psychic symptom is"
"regarding the world as an insecure and uncomfortable place to be,"
and affected persons make frequent remarks to this effect.
It is often difficult to determine a refugee conflict in oneself as it has a great variety
of different manifestations.
"one person may be worried about his economic existence, another one"
is missing somewone else to talk with about his problems.
"But in essence, there is always the same feeling involved. According to my experience,"
"to provide means of existence, security, a home,"
or was not available for addressing his sorrows and needs.
Or perhaps she died.
"So in essence, it is always about a basic confidence in the world, an unconditional feeling of security."
"The mother as the ""center of the universe"" nourishing and protecting us."
"As this causal relation between gaining weight and the renal collecting tubule conflict was not known before,"
all nutrition theories were self-contradictory.
"So many people, despite eating a lot of appearantly fattening food,"
don't gain weight as they feel secure and well.
"They don't need to store anything, as they are not afraid of receiving nothing the next day."
"But persons who feel insecure or badly cared for, usually have littly money,"
(except for those in whom the conflict is centered around another person instead of economic problems).
"So persons who store a lot of water due to their constant financial worrying,"
are of course most likely to be found at places where food is not expensive.
The conclusion that the allegedly inadequate food is the cause of their obesity is now outdated.
"After conflict resolution, when a loved person, security, home, a good place to be"
"is regained, pcl A shows a hypofunction of the renal collecting tubules."
So reabsorbation of water is significantly decreased.
Water is pouring out of you und you have to visit the toilet all the time.
This is the mechanism actually resonsible for losing weight and explains why diets don't work.
"Of course it is also possible to lose weight through sweating or not eating, i. e. spending the reserves."
But resolving the renal collecting tubule conflict should be given top priority.
The great significance of this programme in connection with all other programmes
is due to the swellings that occur in pcl A of every Special Programme.
"The storing of water in the brain and at the organ site in the beginning of pcl is many times exacerbated,"
when at the same time the organism is storing water anyway due to activity of the renal collecting tubules.
this may increase the size of swellings up to ten times.
One can even say that strong pain
and other strong symptoms occur only due to active collecting tubules.
"During activity of the collecting tubules, a bee sting will cause extensive swelling,"
previously misinterpreted as allergy.
"Therefore it is central for every therapy that the patient feels well, protected and secure."
"Because a fact known to established medicine: that symptoms suddenly exacerbate with hospitalisation,"
has now been made plausible.
As soon as a patient is left alone in a hospital bed where hardly anyone is sincerely caring for him
"the so called refugee conflict becomes active, in this case also named hospital conflict,"
more water is stored and swellings increase rapidly.
Thus the very existence of and the procedures in hospitals should be basically reviewed and reconsidered.
"When I was working in the Intencive Care Unit in Freiburg, there were considerations"
"to close the unit, because actually no one escaped from there."
I saw only one who survived - in six years!
This phenomenon explains many seemingly effective therapies.
"A patient with pain may visit a doctor, therapist or practitioner of accupuncture, massage, homeopathy or mental healer or shaman"
"of his own choice, and perhaps the pain is relieving already in the waiting room,"
so that he now feels uncomfortable to have come there at all.
Or when there is an immediate improvement after a conversation or a freely chosen therapy.
"What actually brings about this improvement is that the patient feels no longer helpless, abandoned and alone"
responsible for strong pain or other impairments decrease rapidly.
So the effectiveness of the broad variety of available therapies
"does not have a direct cause in each case, but comes through a by-passing not known to the various therapists."
"But as they could point to many successful applications of their method, they have never had reason to doubt its effectiveness."
Perhaps the often cited bon mot ending all controversies about therapies:
"„Who heals is right“, is refuted after all."
"""Life expectancy decreases fairly proportionally with the number of inhabitants per physician,"
"i. e. with increasing density of physicians"" Scientific institute of German local public health insurance agencies (1979)"
Case report: cervical uterine carcinoma - tachycardia - pulmonar alveoles
They exerted direct pressure on me.
"Along the line: Now you are responsible for a child, and I should go to hospital immediately,"
otherwise I wouldn't survive.
"Even when knowing or studying New Medicine,"
this hits you hard when you are told by someone: you won't survive this.
I was diagnosed with a cervical carcinoma of the uterus
during pregnancy with my son.
"Freqent tests were made, the last one was one year ago, and the parameters always went up and down."
"I mean this Pap classification. They also found those alleged dangerous ""viruses""."
"This refers to the Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) already mentioned before, which according to the Fourth Biological Law"
might be detected in the repair phase of the uterine cervix.
"But without blaming them for the symptoms, as they are (if anything) mere helpers in the repair process,"
as the conflict active phase is already overcome.
the uterine cervical cancer is merely a temporary swelling
after the resolution of a sexual conflict or the loss of one's territory.
"Examples of sexual conflicts may include: - not to be mated, when being left by one's partner"
or when the partner prefers to mate someone else.
in this context we also speak of a sexual frustration conflict.
- to be raped - to watch the parents having sex which frequently happens to children
- to be caught having sex - seen naked if this is felt as an offence
- being revolted by a porn magazine found among daddy's stuff - and lots more.
Little children usually love one of their parents so much
that they even say they want to mary mummy or daddy.
The son usually loves Mummy and the daughter Daddy.
"When they believe that Mummy or Daddy leave them bacause they meet with someone else,"
this can also be interpreted sexually.
So it is not about what we consciously know and have learned about sex and sexual matters.
Everything is already contained in our archaic biological code and is duly interpreted by-passing the intellect.
But which situations are regarded as sexual conflicts depends on indivdual knowledge and maturity.
"For little children, for example, it is inconveivable that their parents have sex"
and to catch them having sex is accordingly a dramatic event.
For older children it is normal that their parents do this
and it does no longer represent a conflict.
Now other matters are associated with sexual conflicts.
"I sought information on New Medicine already during pregnancy, and so I expected"
to develop heart problems after birth in the context of the healing phase.
This assumption is derived from the fact that the uterine cervix and the coronary veins
are controlled by the same brain area and always react simultaneously.
"It was biologically interesting. After pure breastfeeding for seven months,"
"on the first day I gave the first spoons of mash,"
the heart problems started.
"Right after birth, to be honest, I had been thinking, well, New Medicine, established medicine, now having the child"
"I don't want to think about this any longer, and I managed to put it aside somehow."
"And I was just thinking: Despite having the diagnosis cervical cancer, having no troubles"
I don't see the need to go to hospital and be cut open.
"And later when the heart problems started, I realised:"
"So after all, everything is true which has been stated by New Medicine."
And than it was really hard - in the spring I was often lying next to the baby with such heart pain
that I really expected to get a heart attack.
"It was massive angina pectoris, not so much tachycardia,"
but very painful extrasystolics and I was permanently afraid
of collapsing - alone here with the child next to me.
Then I agreed with my brother to call him twice a day
"and if I failed to do so he would send someone to look after me,"
as I was really expecting to drop dead immediately.
Then one night I threw up like several liters of water
which relieved the pressure to the heart all of a sudden.
"It was really amazing. I was afraid of dehydrating, it was so much."
"Afterwards I still had occasional heart pain, but after 2 1/2 months, everything was over."
I was pressed hard by the physicians abiding by established medicine.
"They called me at home and threatened me and appealed to my responsibility as a mother,"
and I should go to hospital and undergo surgery.
The first controversies started during my caesarean section.
I was lying on the operation table - on one hand waiting for the heart attack
- on the other hand I was quarreling with the senior physician.
"You know, this epidural anaesthesia is a great thing. From here on downwards you feel nothing, but your mind is perfectly clear."
Then they took out my child and briefly showed it to me and carried it away - it was horrible.
"Then I said to the senior physician: Only take out the placenta, everything else remains inside, and make the suture."
"And he noted: With your test results, you should have something done. We also have some skills on this field."
I only said: Let's discuss that on another occasion what I think about your skills.
"Due to their massive pressure I was temporarily faltering,"
"but in the end, the entire healing process"
inlcuding the heart problems developed just as predicted by New Medicine.
"And last summer, after I had in fact been death-frightened in the spring,"
I really developed pulmonar problems
and for two weeks I was painfully expectorating blood.
"Then it ended. Since then I've been in perfect health, again."
The whole story was connected to my former boyfriend who is the father of my son.
The resolution of the matter has come so far that I am able to accept that he is his father
but we are not a couple anymore.
"Basically, I have abandoned the idea"
that once again we could be a couple and raise the child together.
"I have concluded this subject. I had been fighting a lot, also for alimony payments."
And experts in New Medicine urgently adviced me to abandon this.
They argued along the line: What is your price for your health?
"And I abandoned it and stopped fighting, and now it works."
"It was only because I had already started doubting the whole thing in my job as an editor,"
I was suspecting that the entire system is flawed.
Already as a pharmaceutical adviser.
"Without this experience, I would have faithfully"
gone under the knife and allowed this whole charade happening.
"And even in spite of my knowledge, the diagnosis was just as shocking for me as to everybody else."
"Although I did more and more reading into New Medicine, everytime a specimen was taken"
"and the parameters went up, it came as another shock again."
You must take it into your own hands.
It is not possible to see someone and just tell him: cure me!
But you are in command of the proceedings yourself and you need to get informed and to act by yourself.
But for most people it is too late to do this when they have not heard about it before.
Handedness
The cause why symptoms occur on the right or on the left side of the body
"is found in handedness, or, more accurately, in brainedness."
"To evaluate handedness quite exactly, Dr. Hamer proposes the clapping test."
Which hand is on top and dominates in clapping?
handedness can be evaluated for example through a simple clapping test.
When I clap in my hands the right hand is leading and on top.
So I am right-handed.
Because this is done intuitively. So the test is unconscious.
The test is efficient because no trained movement is conducted.
Many people were taught to write with their right hand although they are more inclined to use the left hand.
As many devices and tools are constructed for right hand use we are left no choice but to become right handed.
Many who seem to be right handed will be amazed when their left hand is on top
"or leading in the clapping test, although they do almost everything with their right hand."
"As has been said before, handedness is actually brainedness."
right handed individuals are left brained and left handed ones are right brained.
Left handers don't constitute such a small minority as widely believed
but their proportion is about 38%.
The two halves of our body differ according to our handedness.
"Our strong side reacts to persons who are on our level, our weak side to persons above or below us in a hierarchy."
"they are often briefly called ""partner side"" and ""mother/child side"","
describing the most frequent empirical findings.
"On the same level side, persons are sensed with whom you deal on an eye to eye basis."
"This may be a partner, a colleague, a rival, in many cases one's father,"
behaving more like a buddy in contrast to the mother.
On the hierarchy side we sense persons who are clearly above or below us
or whom we feel obliged to protect.
"Regularly, this applies to the mother, one's own children, sometimes the father"
or a person one admires or greatly respects.
"Pets usually belong to this side, too,"
as they are clearly subordinated and have to be herded.
"A life partner may also be sensed here,"
when playing a mother's or father's role for the other one.
"For example, when a right handed woman has a caring/quarreling conflict"
- resulting in hyperfunction of the mammary glands -
"with her partner, the process would take place in the right breast."
"In the left handed woman, everything would take place on the opposite side."
These sensations are however not as clear cut as presented so far.
"For example, a conflict with one's daughter could be sensed on both sides"
"when at the moment of the conflict, she is regarded both as a daughter and as a rival."
Or when a partner is regarded in part as partner and in part as a child.
In this way bilateral and sometimes perfectly symmetrical symptoms appear.
"However, handedness is not always of significance."
"More accurately, it is of significance everywhere except in the organs controlled by the brain stem"
"such as the tonsils, the middle ear, stomach and bowel."
"In these cases, which side is affected depends on the morsel-in/morsel-out scheme"
which cannot be explained any further in this documentary.
So the significance of handedness extens to the following groups:
"organs of old-brain-mesoderm, these are organs with a protective function"
for examples mammary glands or corium.
"Organs of new-brain-mesoderm which provide power and stability,"
"for example bone, muscles, connective tissue and tendons."
And the ectodermal organs responsible for conscious sensation and territorial behaviour.
A left handed football player who has not been hitting the goal for weeks and is bullied by everyone
will have a conflict of self-devaluation in his left knee.
The left side is affected as it is responsible for equal persons such as the team mates or the public.
"As soon as he hits the goal again, his conflict of self-devaluation is resolved,"
"the process enters the repair phase, he will develop swelling and pain in his knee,"
"something which can be followed easily in the sports coverage,"
when the pain sets in right after a period of unsuccessful playing has ended.
The locus of the conflict of self-devaluation depends on the corresponding activity.
"So the foot or knee is usually affected in football players,"
while a keeper or a tennis player is more likely to suffer in the elbow.
"Out of ignorance of the Five Biological Laws, this was previously attributed to attrition,"
as the body was considered to slowly rust in like a machine.
"The repair symptoms themselves, however, accompanied by pain and impairment,"
often lead the patients into a vicious circle.
Here is another exception to the rule of handedness in these types of tissues.
"Handedness is only relevant in ""globally"" sensed conflicts."
But there are also local conflicts referring exactly to the spot where they were sensed.
"When I feel revolted by a kiss or the touch of an animal,"
"A conflict relating to separation, attack or besmirching is sensed exactly at this spot."
"Handedness is irrelevant in this case, the symptoms"
(herpes or other skin symptoms in this example) will appear exactly at the affected spot.
"When the lefthanded football player has suffered a conflict of self-devaluation in the left knee,"
the repair symptoms can cause a new local conflict of self-devaluation.
"This is when he thinks that his knee is dysfunct, he is invalid at this spot."
"So the Programme starts anew with cell depletion, and as soon as the conflict is resolved again,"
the repair phase returns with cell proliferation and pain due to swelling.
"This is why many people never escape these vicious circles, as they see the repair symptoms"
"always as evidence for their body being invalid, dysfunct or wrongful at the affected spot."
But if one succeeds in accepting the pain as a necessary part of the repair process
"without interpreting it as a wrongful condition of the body, it is possible to escape the vicious circle."
"When one attributes pain or other symptoms to ones own age,"
this may also cause a conflict of self-devaluation.
The feeling might be: My body is less valid due to its age.
I am no more able to do everything I have done.
"A doctor's diagnosis to the effect: ""You will never again be able to walk"" may precisely result in what it predicts,"
as a conflict of self-devaluation or a motorical conflict in one's leg
are followed by the kind of impairmant the doctor has appearantly correctly foretold.
Relapses and tracks
The Five Biological Laws also explain those conditions
previously described as allergies or chronic diseases.
"For better understanding, the old names should be abandoned,"
as they are based on an outdated reference system.
"The first thing to mention is the constant recurrence of a conflict matter,"
for instance the boss whom one has to endure every day.
Necessitating the same Special Programme everyday anew.
"As the conflict is also resolved again every day, the same repair symptoms are always present."
This direct recurrence of a conflict matter is what we call a relapse.
It is important to understand that only the first occurence of the Programme requires a DHS.
From then on its activation can be triggered by mere recognition of the old conflict matter
"even in the absence of a highly acute, dramatic and isolating situation, i. e. a DHS."
When a baby cannot get a certain toy and suffers a DHS from this
"activating a Programme of the right tonsil, it will react to all situations of not being able to get anything"
"occuring later in its life, with this Special Programme."
"These might no longer be connected to a toy, but, for instance, to a car or a partner."
"A baby that could not get a toy because it was unable to grab it,"
"and reacting to this with a conflict of self-devaluation of the right wrist,"
will react to the situation of not-being-able-to-get-something in the wrist for all its life.
"So the principal DHS determines our later mode of reacting, as it provided us with a successful survival strategy."
"In the first example, the baby shows a very archaic reaction as it conceives the toy as a morsel of food it desires."
Which is facilitated through increased secretion of mucus by the tonsils.
The second baby has a less archaic reaction of not-being-able-to-grab.
A third baby might conceive the situation as one of not-being-able-to-bite-into-something and henceforth react with the teeth.
Another way to produce chronic processes is constant medical suppression of repair symptoms.
"When for example, a long lasting repair phase never comes to a finish,"
as sympathicotonia is generated time and again to quickly relieve pain.
"When the impact of the medicine decreases, the repair phase continues."
The molesting symptoms return. This can be continued ad infinitum.
Let us come now to the so called tracks which are somewhat difficult to understand to recognise.
which requires a lot of practical experience.
"In principle, it is the same as with relapses."
An immediate reoccurence of the conflict matter is however not necessary.
tracks work much more subtly and unconsciously.
The basic rule appears simple:
"In the moment of the DHS, all circumstantial features are unconsciously remembered and function as tracks."
"These circumstantial features may comprise everything the organism is able to sense, images, smells,"
"a certain thought one was having in mind at the time, persons, things, sounds, temperature, a single word, etc."
"When one of these circumstantial features is recognised, the complete Special Programme of the principal DHS unfolds anew."
An example: A boy who loves a girl.
He suffers a DHS when seeing her kissing another boy.
"This is highly acute and dramatic for him, entirely unexpected, and he is left alone with it."
Let us assume he conceived the situation in these two ways:
"It is a ""conflict of visual separation"", the conjunctiva and eyelids are affected."
He was unable to scent that she loved another one.
The Special Programme of the nasal mucosa (scenting conflict) is started.
Now everything happens in a spring scene.
"The sun is shining, flowers are blooming, the sky is blue, and bees are buzzing around his head."
pollen is filling the air.
Let's assume that after some time he has forgotten the conflict or it has become obsolete.
He undergoes the usual repair phases of the Special Programmes.
"This appears as conjunctivitis, a swollen eye and rhinitis."
"In the next spring, all his tracks are present again."
"The weather, the smell, the bees, the pollen, everything reminds him of the deceased love."
The same Special Programmes become biologically necessary again.
"Subsequently, he will again have an eye inflammation and a running nose with sneezing."
"He might keep these reactions to spring-connected circumstances for all his life,"
unless he is able to consciously disconnect these circumstances from the situation with the girl.
A conscious relapse - to wich he would show a significantly stronger reaction .
would be to meet the girl or her new lover incidentally.
The unconscious tracks are merely connected to the circumstances and run more subtly.
This was one out of an infinite number of possible examples.
"There is no limit to possible situations, and every case is entirely individual."
So a lot of experience with these correlations is required.
There is no text book formula explaining the origin of any allergy XY.
But the symptoms tell us what kind of conflict the principal DHS must have been.
"Resolution of tracks can either be achieved by resolving the original conflict,"
"whatever it may have been, or through realising that they are irrelevant to the original conflict matter."
making the Special Programmes unnecessary.
This is often successfully applied with regard to conflicts stemming from childhood
and whose contents are no longer relevant to the grown-up.
The present speaker has been able to experience on himself
how twisted and at the same time unambigous these relations may be.
I found on my bed table a wrapped but already used lollypop from my then girlfriend.
"She was not on the spot, but she had left her lollypop there."
So it crossed my mind to take the lollypop. I put it into my mouth and continued with my business.
"A few minutes later, I felt my lip prickling."
I was puzzled and had no clue as to what had happened.
Then I realised that I was developing herpes. My lips were swollen. Why?
What had I been doing just until then? Nothing. I'd been doing nothing special all day.
The only change was my putting a lollypop into my mouth a moment ago.
"So, there had to be some track connected in some way with the lollypop. Sugar?"
Sugar seemed an unlikely guess as you eat it frequently without getting herpes from it.
I recalled a previous occurence of herpes two weeks before.
"On that weekend, my lips had been covered with four spots of herpes."
I had developed another one every day. What had happened?
I tried to find some similarities with the present situation.
"And indeed, in the previous case, a colleague of mine had brought from the city centre"
a bagful of candy cane and offered them to us.
and every evening I ate a candy cane and every evening
"I developed a big herpes, and my lips were enormously swollen for all the weekend."
"Within two weeks it disappeared, and then this situation at home occured: I ate the lollypop and herpes returned."
"So we have sugar, lollypop, candy cane, some form of it, but not simple sugar."
It had to be some solid form of sugar. My track was connected to something like this.
"So I was thinking what it meant and why, and what had happened earlier to me,"
Why I want to be separated - or not separated - from the lollypop.
"Actually, I had no idea."
"Except, that when I was little, my parents told me"
"not to take any sweets and candy from strangers, because they want to trap and kidnap you."
"I couldn't recall a specific situation when my parents said this,"
but I have an image imprinted on my mind.
I see a blue Mercedes arriving and a man with a coat offers me candy.
And lures me. It's imprinted on my mind.
I don't know why. There has never been such a situation. It's only in my head.
"Perhaps I was in a situation,"
"So that I was thinking: God, I mustn't accept it, for then I would be abducted."
"This is possible, but I don't know, I don't remember anything."
"But I know: Accepting sweets and candy from strangers, for a child means to be abducted."
"Or at least there is a risk to be abducted. But I didn't want to be abducted, be separated"
"from my parents, from my home, and so everything becomes logical: I put a lollypop into my mouth"
"I found in my home but it was neither bought by my parents nor by me,"
"And healing sets in immediately after a brief acitivity of the Programme,"
"because I was at home and realised that I am not going to be abducted,"
"all right, I'm well and everything is fine."
"And the same had happened two weeks before, when I had eaten all the candy canes, and everytime I realised"
"I am not abducted, so for instance when returning home, herpes began to grow."
Now the question is: Is it possible to resolve a track when it has been recognised?
"In my case I was able to do so, as I knew:"
"I am now grown-up, I'm a tough guy and I cannot be abducted."
There is no man who sexually desires me and wants to kidnap me.
"Some old man who abducts little children, as one is always frightened of,"
parents are always frightened that their children are abducted by old men.
"This won't happen, as I am grown-up."
"I cannot be subject to this pedophilia any more, and even if I would be abducted I could defend myself."
As I am now grown-up and tall and strong.
"Nothing can happen to this effect, the conflict has become entirely obsolete, and therefore, I can now accept"
"lollypops and candy from strangers, from people other than myself or my parents,"
without developing herpes upon returning home.
"It's all over. These skin tracks that have been thrilling me for all my life,"
"for 25 or 20 years, from early childhood, they are gone."
"And thus, I am almost free from herpes. Thanks."
"Besides, it wouldn't work anyway. This is not a lollypop or candy, sugar. It's chocolate. I haven't had a track connected to this."
And neither when yourself or your parents had bought lollypops?
"No, nothing happened then. That's what made it so hard to hit on it."
"It must be from a stranger, it mustn't be from my parents, otherwise I would have found it earlier."
"We must have a stranger, this can also be my girlfriend."
"It must be a lollypop not purchased by myself or given to me by my parents,"
but by a person alien to me.
"The widespread conceptions of cat allergy, hay fever,"
pollen allergy were entirely inaccurate or wrong.
Almost never has there been a real connection to the idiomatic pollen or hay.
There had not been any explanation how it was possible by any means to pyhsically react
"to TV news or images, on the basis of the assumption"
of some stricly chemical intolerance to certain substanec.
"Of course, allergy tests do exist."
"From the view of the Five Biological Laws, however, they represent nothing but injuries."
"And depending on the level of renal collecting tubules activity, more or less swelling will follow these traumata."
There was an astronomical error rate which seems not to have troubled anyone.
"According to these tests, for instance, almost everyone is allergic to cats or grass,"
but most of these people have been living with cats or lying in the grass without harm for years.
A phenomenon frequently observed is that a doctor's statement
"that a person suffers an intolerance against this and that substance, fulfills istself."
She will subseqently react with Special Programmes to thinks against whicht the Doctor has warned her.
"So the Doctor's statment is already proven, because people trust him so much."
As soon as one realises that a certain substance does not do any harm.
The term: allergic reactions has been solely applied to tissues that quickly produce peculiar physical symptoms
"such as the skin, the respiratory tract, nasal mucosa, conjunctiva."
"All other Special Programmes, however, stick to the same pattern."
"But of course, a slowly growing bowel tumor is noticed only after months, not minutes."
So it would hardly have any noticeable effect in the present context.
The same is of course also true for the psychic symptoms of Special Programmes.
"So tracks do have an impact on our thinking, feeling acting and our view towards the world."
Another way in which allergies have been misinterpreted is illustrated by the following example:
"Assume that a child looses its beloved cat, showing a skin reaktion according to a biological conflict"
of not being able to hug it anymore;
"with a conflict of scenting as the cat cannot be scented anymore,"
and with a visual conflict of separation as the cat cannot be seen anymore.
"When the child now visits a house where a cat lives, it has the subconscious notion:"
Oh! The cat is here again! And the repair symptoms come immediately.
"In this case skin exanthema, nasal obstruction and conjunctivitis."
"With the cat disappearing again, the repair phase stops."
Only to continue with the same discomforting symptoms upon the next occurence of a cat.
In situations like this it can be observed that people react most intensely to a cat
similar to their own and less intensely to a cat that differs more from their own.
How is this possible if not due to recognition?
Presentation in Public
Is New Medicine banned?
This claim was apparently circulated by Dr. Hamer himself and has been widely spread.
But is it correct?
"The ""Faktuell"" Publishing house which has released several books on the Five Biological Laws"
"made a written inquiry of all public health agencies, asking whether Dr. Hamer's New Medicine was banned."
"Thes gist of all answers was crystal clear: It is not banned, there is freedom of therapy and doctors may do what they want."
"Some agencies, however, uttered a warning against New Medicine, based on the misunderstandings"
and false claims about New Medicine haunting the internet.
"So for instance the article on Wikipedia is frequently referred to,"
as Wikipedia is still regarded to be tantamount to objective truth.
Let's have a closer look on it:
"Right in the first sentence, it talks about an ""uneffective ideology of treatment""."
New Medicine however does not represent a treating method but merely describes Five Biological Laws
whose correctness is independent of a patient's life or death.
"Thus the term ""uneffective"" cannot be applied."
Just as the law of gravitation is not refuted by a piano falling on someone's head.
Further below it is claimed that Dr. Hamer considers cancer part of a natural healing process
which is entirely opposed to the actual statement of the Third Biological Law.
"Through the entire text, skillful use of rhetorical instruments leaves an uninformed reader with no other choice"
than to conclude Hamer is a psychopath and weirdo.
"For instance people who have a positive opinion of his discovery are referred to as his ""followers"","
creating the impression of a sect.
"It is routinely mentioned that Dr. Hamer lost his practitioner's license, but without giving the reason."
It can be found in a letter from the Koblenz disctrict government dated 8 April 1986.
"It states: ""There is no indication that Dr. Hamer is prepared"
"to renounce his ""iron rule of cancer""."""
"Furthermore, Dr. Hamer is found incapable to listen to reason"
"and be ""converted"" again to established medicine."
"In violation of physicians' duty, Dr. Hamer wasn't offering chemotherapy. This is why he was banned from practicing in his profession."
"The wording ""to convert"" is usually applied to religious matters"
and should have no place in science.
The Wikipedia articel contains many more false statements that can also be found on various pages on the internet.
A list of hyperlinks related to the subject contains not a single reference to a page where a positive assessment is given.
"Thus, there can be no talk about objective reporting."
"What can be found, however, is a statement by the German Cancer Association."
"For instance, Dr. Sölker is quoted as saying ""that psychical factors might have an influence"
"on the etiology of cancerous diseases"" a belief now considered scientifically refuted."
"Unfortunately, it must have escaped Mr. Sökler's notion that Dr. Hamer has not given the psyche as a cause."
"Also note the word ""considered"". It ""is"" not refuted, but ""considered to be"" refuted."
"It also reads: ""Studies from Denmark have shown unambiguously that there is no elevated rate of cancer"
"in people suffering from depression"" which, again, has no relevance to any of Dr. Hamer's statements."
"At no point, reference is made to the actual contents of the Five Biological Laws,"
and this is what the concluding statement says:
"""Mr. Hamer's so called ""German New Medicine"" is a therorem merely grounded in his personal history and dreams"
"with no scientific or empirical foundation whatsoever."""
"Dr. Hamer's book ""Legacy of a New Medicine"" reveals that when he made his first discoveries,"
"he frequently dreamed of his dead son, inspiring him to further research."
It will however remain Dr. Sökler's secret how the scores of
scientific and empirical proofs that Dr. Hamer offered could have escaped his notion.
"""Its distribution must be prevented with all available means -"
"judicial and educational."""
For this reason we ask you now to delete this video immediately and forget all its contents.
Other homepages maintain outright lists of people
who allegedly died at the hands of Dr. Hamer.
Most of the people listed there had agreed to a standard therapy
"In some of these death lists, Chrisoph Buck's name appears as well."
"Now that he appearently returned from the other world, we've sought his opinion of these things."
When I first found myself on these death lists
"where I was listed in advance, with the expectation: This Christoph Buck will also die soon,"
My initial thought was that this is too much.
"I considered to move against it, but then on the other hand I was pleased"
and installed a link to my homepage and registered frequent visits from this.
"And then I was thinking the owner of this homepage is a miserable guy,"
"he is known as one of the worst mud-slingers on the internet, not only to those who"
approve New Medicine but to many different groups of people.
He also set up a forum where he maintains files about various people.
"Some months ago, I learned that I have now my own file there."
Of course I was honoured that I had been chosen to belong to that circle.
"There are files about Dr. Hamer, Mr. Pilhar and others, and now as well about Christoph Buck."
"As long as you are working with ill people, there is always that risk, that you might not win."
That you cannot control that physiological process.
"And just by knowing ""new medicine"" we understand, that the environment,"
"in which the person lives, is very important for getting healthy."
And this environment is sometimes what we cannot take influence on today.
"Additional to that is, that usually the people interested in ""new medicine"" are people"
"who don't have much hope in established medicine,"
"that have tried a lot of therapeutic application, that have just tried a lot"
"and that are now in their desperation just seeking for another possibility, but are still"
"from their believes, still stuck in the hypnosis of the evil disease."
"Under these circumstances it's very hard to achieve health,"
or very hard to control a biological process when people are in deep desperation
"in fear of what they have heard from established medicine, seeking a last possibility"
"Knowing the ""new medicine"" we can say, that we do have a new idea of"
how disease is created and how health is created.
But still there is no all healing potion.
The possibilities of controlling such a process are still reduced to the frame of abilities
of the therapist and the possibilities of the patient - what they can achieve together.
"No, we cannot approach every case."
"Of course, a serious trauma, for instance, requires hospitalisation."
Or an intoxication reqires its specific antidote.
"But apart from this, I havent' rejected anyone so far."
It becomes difficult when a patient's attitude is:
Now it's up to you! When he doesn't understand that he must cure himself.
"In 1995, the case of Olivia Pilhar drew great attention from the media. A detailed case report"
from her parents' and her own perspective can be found on the web page: Olivia-Tagebuch.at
One of the opinions held by Dr. Hamer is that Zionist circles would keep his discovery for themselves
and deliberately kill all non-Jews with chemo and morphine.
Jewish doctors would operate according to the Five Biological Laws
so that mortality is very small among their patients.
We are not aware of and have not been able to find any any proof for these claims.
So we must explicitly dissociate ourselves from them.
The only existing confirmations cannot be verified.
A comparison between the official cancer mortality data from Israel and those from Germany and Austria
doesn't yield numbers that speak in favour of Dr. Hamer's claim.
"Dr. Hamer has made this phantastic discovery of New Medicine,"
"but presently, as a private person he does no longer work in favour"
"of its distribution - which of course, has no impact on the greatness of his discovery."
But most people mix these things up.
"Measured by his discovery, Dr. Hamer is surely a genius of our times."
His way of working in medical science is influenced
by his enduring and strong personality.
With this strong enduring personality he was gifted to keep on exploring
"against all odds and resistance, following his idea,"
giving him the abilities to discover these 5 laws of nature.
But the same personality is doing very hard in explaining something new in a diplomatic way.
"This means, these aspects of his personality keep him claiming the right"
"the right respecting scientific facts, that he made a discovery,"
which is scientifically true and needs to be applied now for sanity and reason.
Unfortunately not all people behave like that.
"If all people had this strong believe in equaty, for sure,"
the 5 laws of nature would be applied in daily clinical service.
"Those published communications, they are always ""against"","
"against the ""medicynics"", to use Dr. Hamer's expression, against the authorities, againt the physicians,"
"against the people working in the public health agencies, it is always ""against""."
"And every attack inevitably results in a counter-attack, and this ends up in a kindergarden game"
"Hit me, and i'll hit you back. This doesn't lead anywhere."
I strongly advocate separating New Medicine from all ideologies
and political matters as well as this assigning of blame.
The whole thing should be looked upon as such and people should begin to learn New Medicine
"and employ this knowledge on themselves, or in the case of physicians, on their patients."
Just observe every case and see if it is in accordance;
I think this is the way to quickly resolve unanswered questions.
"But to assign blame and to insist: Why are we not yet recognised, and the industry and so on..."
"This is not helpful, and, in my opinion, should be abandoned. These issues will automatially be settled"
when more people have learnt of New Medicine.
"""Nothing is more damaging to a new truth than an old error"" Goethe"
"In my opinion, the main problem is not some suppression, but what I experience everyday"
"in trying to familiarise people with the subject is that they are standing in their own way, they don't understand it,"
"they have all sorts of biases, and the Five Biological Laws"
cannot be grasped in passing just like other subjects.
"No, the system is complex and requires profound studying,"
There is no purpose in waitning for others to understand it for you.
It won't work when you don't do it yourself.
"And as for all those introductions and schematic explanations to be found on the internet and in many books,"
I just don't find them helpful.
When I recall the time when I myself was in need of introductions
they rather puzzled and misled me as they oversimpliflied things.
"So, there's still lacking a lot."
"The strongest suppressor of New Medicine is ourselves, being afraid"
of taking responsibility for ourselves and to recognise the cause of disease or the cause
of special biological reactions or what the actual causes of symptoms or symptomatic complexes are.
People are used to go to the doctor when they are sick
"and he tells them what to do, so they don't need to take any responsibility."
"or likewise, when they undergo homeopathy or accupuncture. They don't have to take part in it."
The effects would reach far beyond the scope of medicine when people would actually begin
to internalise these biological laws and to learn and verify them.
What's new is that every process can be verified by everyone.
"And at this point, the power of all these dogms controlling our lives ends, state dogms,"
"religious and party dogms, they just pass, as the human is solely responsible for his own life."
"And this is ingenious, reaching far beyond the scope of medicine."
Today I think that the strongest opposition arises precisely from the fear of this.
"That people suddenly become fully self-reliant, merely due to their understanding,"
that they themselves are the beginning and the end of every process. And this is breathtaking.
I strongly advice everyone to familiarise himself with New Medicine as long as he is still healthy.
To verify it everyday in order to consolidate the knowledge and strengthen the confidence so that
"when there eventually is a problem or a major conflict,"
"which might even lead to a serious disease, you are fully equipped."
Otherwise it is like learning to swim while drowning.
"It doesn't suffice to download four or five pages somewhere from the internet,"
"to read through it and to say: OK, cancer results from unresolved conflicts."
"One ought to go further into it, as it is different for different diseases."
"Some ""diseases"" (in quotation marks) are symptoms of the healing phase,"
and some organic findings or diseases are symptoms of unresolved conflicts.
so to make a distinction requires some knowledge.
"Otherwise, when I have a running nose, I will search for a conflict,"
"while I already resolved it long ago,"
and the running nose ise merely a symptom of the healing phase.
Anyhow I wish to thank Dr. Hamer from the bottom of my heart for his merits regarding New Medicine.
"It is so wide and great, and when you for once have understood how Mother Nature ticks,"
"you realise that there is nothing left to improve, we only have to understand Mother Nature."
"Dr. Hamer has succeeded in getting these Laws on their way, and this is already such an invaluable exploit"
"that I am very grateful, just like many other people who have understood New Medicine."
I have always restricted myself to invoking Dr. Hamer's medical theory
"and never concentrated on the political aspect, as this was met by a lot of reluctance,"
"first of all from myself, which prevented me from dealing with New Medicine for an entire year."
It is up to you to verify for yourself everything you've seen here.
So get informed. It rests in your hands to proof this knowledge.
We are merely pointing at the door. But it is for you to enter.
"""A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents"
"and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die,"
"and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it"" Max Planck"
"The author of the book, ""Thank you Dr. Hamer"", Claudio Trupiano, said in Italian"
- and I'll just translate with my Italian knowing -
"that we are experiencing a splendid time, and that we are the generation experiencing to come out of the fear towards freedom,"
"and that following generations, maybe cannot appreciate this pleasure"
"to see, what what has always been there. Great saying."
"For beginners, this documentary is incredibly detailed"
and only ten percent of all this can be grasped.
I advise you to watch it again and again and again.
And everytime you will notice a vast number of new things that had not drawn your attention before.
"Or if you think it's all bullshit, abandon it and go to some forum in order to rail against us"
for the sort of bullshit we spread here and for what dangerous death sect we are.
It is also clear that on first encounter there come up
contradictions to the old belief and just as many questions arise.
For it is nothing less then a paradigm shift.
"That is, the observations one has constantly made during all one's prior life are still as correct as before."
"But they are given a fundamentally new explanation, and this is quite puzzling."
There are good answers to the scores of questions that may have piled up until now or that are still to come.
"But of course, there is no space for them in this documentary."
Our homepage has an FAQ addressing some of the typical questions from beginners.
"And in our forum, you may ask as many questions as you like."
"It is difficult to get into the subject, since paradigm shifts occur only once in a couple of hundreds of years,"
and no one of us has witnessed one before.
From history it can be seen that paradigm shifts
And all of them went through these characteristic stages:
"First they were ridiculed, then fought against, then kept silent about and eventually everything was recognised as a matter of course."
Now this is perhaps the first paradigm shift occuring in the era of the internet.
So it might develop more quickly this time.
But still it depends on every single person.
"Who has not understood the system by himself, is still tied with drugs and vaccinations."
"But when no one continues to play the game, it will implode by itself."
"And please don't believe! Verify, self-reliantly!"
"When you start searching the internet for the credibility of all this, then you haven't understood this."
"I took a considered decision against presenting all those certifications by universites, professors, physicians and others"
who confirmed Dr. Hamer that the whole thing is correct.
"Because, again, this would be a matter of belief instead of self-acquired knowledge."
"And, again, you would have the choice to believe Dr. Hamer"
or to believe that these documents are forgeries or whatever.
"There's a lot of quarreling about this on the internet. But in most cases, there is no self-reliant verification."
But these Biological Laws are only for strictly self-reliant people.
it is not about diseases in the first place.
Every single scene in life must now be viewed from a new perspective.
"Who expects the doctor merely to end his suffering, cannot be helped by New Medicine."
"New Medicine is only for those who are prepared to learn the Biological Laws,"
"to understand and to verify them, and to take responsiblitiy for all symptoms himself."
"when someone attributes every littly aching to external factors, some alleged causative agents,"
"cancerogene substances, a wrong diet, lack of physical activity, the immune system, just all of this bubble,"
"then, while this person's behaviour may well be subject to our analysis based on the Biological Laws,"
this person is definitely not prepared for New Medicine.
There is no alternative to taking self-responsibility.
Are the Five Biological Laws correct?
Absolutely. Everyone can verify them by himself on a single day.
Starting with a common cold or some skin irritions.
"Literally everything can be explained by New Medicine, and it is correct."
"Unabmbiguously, without doubt and at one hundred percent."
Yes - sure.
"From my point of view, I would say that the conception and the approach of New Medicine is certainly true."
"Now, if every single disease has as its cause the conflict given by Dr. Hamer,"
"if this is always one hundred percent true, I cannot confirm."
I don't know it and I cannot verify it. But I am of the opinion that New Medicine is correct.
"I have been studying New Medicine for four years, I made my own experiences with New Medicine,"
not only with patients but also with myself as well as friends and relatives
and I deeply feel that New Medicine is correct.
"After what I've seen, what I've experienced, yes!"
"I will however not make the claim that it is true, as I would like to ask every person to verify yourself."

The lemon phrase
"Fourteen-year-old Tanja observes: It's strange, whenever someone tells me:"
"""Imagine yourself biting into a lemon"", my mouth starts watering."
So there's a lot of spittle. Although I don't really bite into a lemon.
How does this work?
The best way to clarify this question is passing it on to profound science.
"In order to track the cause of the phenomenon, a German scientist requests research funds."
The request is granted as he was clever enough to mention that the results of his imminent research
would have great impact on our understanding of reality
and would - could - or might therefore mean a great leap forward for mankind.
"In the beginning, there's a hypothesis."
Based on the guess that the specific measurable sequence of sonic waves might be the cause
"And what do you think? Everyone exposed to the sonic wave sequence of the phrase ""Imagine yourself biting into a lemon"""
"Already the slightest phonetic variation such as ""Imagine yourself writing into a lemon"""
fails to provoke this specific physical reaction.
The hypothesis is proofed by all measurements.
The study is bublished in a scientific journal
"and noticed, assessed, applauded and quoted by the scientific community."
"A Chinese scientist, however, casts doubt on it."
"To corroborate his doubts, he copies the experimental setting"
and exposes his Chinese probands to the lemon phrase.
None of them reacts with increased saliva production - except one.
"A young Chinese who has lived in Germany for three years, promptly reacts to the specific sequence of sonic waves."
This gives rise to a new hypothesis: lemon phrase-sensitivity is a local but highly contagious phenomenon.
Repeated examinations of Chinese persons who were living in Germany reveal:
"The more time the probands have been spending in Germany, the more likely have they become infected."
The study is published in a scientific journal
"and noticed, assessed, applauded and quoted by the scientific community."
"An Australian scientist, however, casts doubt on it."
His genetic comparison between Germans and Chinese reveals
a significant correlation between slitted eyes and lemon phrase-sensitivity.
What's striking: 99% of the examined cases speak in favor of this. A new hypothesis is born.
The gene responsible for slitted eyes seems at the same time to prevent
the lemon phrase from unfolding its possible effect.
The study is published in a scientific journal
"and noticed, assessed, applauded and quoted by the scientific community."
"A Russian scientist, however, casts doubt on it."
"Because, in Russia, too, all people except those"
"who were living in Germany for some time, are resistant although they have no spitted eyes."
The Russian corroborates the Chinese and refutes the Australian.
The Australian and those advocating his hypothesis counter this criticism on the grounds
"that in certain parts of Russia, people do have after all rudimentary features of spitted eyes."
"Finally, a multi-factor causality is agreed on."
this conclusion is published in a scientific journal
"and noticed, assessed, applauded and quoted by the scientific community."
"Everyone likes the multi-hypothesis,"
as it takes into account all measurable and visible factors researched so far
and contains the result of several studies.
"Thus, it cannot be that far from the truth."
"Tanja gets logged in to the physics forum with her nickname sunflower_14, she clicks on the section"
"""etherism and other nonsense"", choses the thread about the lemon phrase and writes:"
"Now, I think, it has more to do with the content of the phrase and if you are able to understand it,"
like the feeling you have when you hear the phrase.
"Because, for myself it also works with the spittle."
The graduated physicist and passionate Eso basher hartmut_666 gets logged in and writes:

Now that we have a reasonable understanding of why austerity is very difficult. 
1) There probably isn't the political will to do it. 
"And even more, it might drive Greece into a bigger recession. "
And we also understand why defaulting isn't an option for Greece 
and we understand what a monetarily independent Greece would have done. 
"We can now get a good sense of what Greece is likely to do, outside any other intervention, "
outside any help from other Euro Zone members. 
"In future videos, we will talk about why other Euro Zone members do have some incentive to try and stop Greece from doing what I'm about to articulate. "
"So in an ideal world, Greece, if it had its own currency, would just print away and be able to inflate away its obligations. "
"Also, if it had its own currency, and this is not necessarily a good thing to do, "
"because it will undermine investor trust going forward, "
"but even defaulting would be an option, because they would still have access to their own currency "
"and then they could just keep printing and then lending to that government, "
"then the government could continue to pay the nominal obligations, "
"but since they're getting inflated away, in real terms they would become lower and lower. "
"So what Greece, if it doesn't get any help from other Euro Zone members, "
"if it does not get bailed out in some way, what is likely to happen is that Greece leaves the Euro. "
"And the actual mechanics of that, and it will probably go back to a new form of the drachma. "
And the way that that would actually happen mechanically is that they would declare a banking holiday. 
"And it sounds like a very nice thing like everything which had a world ""holiday"" in it "
"but a banking holiday is essentially a forced shut down of all of the banks for some period of time, "
over which they can do transition into the new currency. 
"And so, entering into the banking holiday the Euro was the currency, "
"and the money you had in your bank was denominated in Euro, "
"but exiting the banking holiday the drachma will be the currency, "
and the money that you have in the bank will be the drachma. 
And what the government will essentially do is set some type of conversion rate over that banking holiday. 
They'll maybe say every one Euro you have will be converted into one drachma. 
And then just the exchange markets will determine 
what the actual exchange between a euro and a drachma is going forward. 
And so then everybody would buy and sell in drachma. 
And the government would also say all of our obligations are now in drachma. 
Which would essentially be a default because if they told to their debtors 
"that ""we no longer owe you....[where is the number?] 356 billion euros"", "
"or actually close to 400 billion or whatever the number is, "
"""we do not longer owe you 400 billion euros"", "
"they are now going to say ""we owe you 400 billion drachma."" "
"Or they can even say, we're only going to pay you 200 billion drachma, "
"or a 100 billion drachma. But no matter what they say, "
"even if they say they are going to give you a trillion drachma, that would still be a default on the debt "
"because these debtors, in order to fulfill these obligations, they were expecting euro. "
"And if you give them anything other than euro, "
"if you give them strawberries or bananas or drachma, that is a default. "
"So no matter how many drachma they say they're going to give, "
this would constitute a default on their debt. 
But the Greek people could actually then move on with their lives. 
"And there's all sorts of crazy things that would happen, "
but at least now the government would be able to print its own money and use 
"it to buy government debt, and continue to fund government spending "
and eventually inflate away its obligations. 
"You could imagine a situation that, right now, "
"its real GDP is, let's say it's the equivalent of 100 drachma. "
"And then by just keep printing drachma, the actual productivity of the economy doesn't change. "
"It actually might improve if money is printed, but you don't get to hyper inflation. "
"Let's say over the next 10 years that the real GDP doesn't change, "
"but the nominal GDP, due to inflation over the next 10 years, becomes 500. "
"Prices in general, ...so inflation, you had 5x inflation. "
"Things become worth 5 times as much, you produce the same goods and services, "
"they are now worth 5x as much. But now, that debt that you have, "
your taxes are going to grow with inflation because they are a % of your GDP 
but your actual debt obligations won't change. 
"So in real terms, they'll be 1/5 as much, which all of a sudden, makes them sustainable. "
"Now, as I said, this is not a simple thing to do. And not a painless to do. "
"And we haven't even started talking about the repercussions for the rest of Europe, and why this might be scary, "
"and make other people suspicious of countries like Spain and Italy, etc. "
"And even in Greece this would be painful. Because you can imagine, "
"you can imagine, we're already starting to see this in May of 2012. "
"The government will say every euro in your bank account will now be a drachma, "
but the people there they know better than just believing that a drachma is going to be worth the same as a euro. 
"They're going to know that as soon as the drachma starts exchanging on foreign exchange markets, "
that the actual reality is 1 drachma is going to be worth something closer to maybe .6 of a euro. 
Or .7 of a euro. 
Let's say it's .7 of a euro. 
"So essentially by this happening, everyone's savings and deposits, "
"in real terms, in terms of their global buying power is going to go down by 30% overnight. "
And the Greek people are already seeing that. 
"They are seeing the possibility of a banking holiday, and a conversion to the drachma. "
And so that's why you have people waiting in line before this happens and trying to withdraw their euros. 
"So people are starting to withdraw their euros, "
and if they have a Swiss bank account they can deposit it there 
or they can just take the euros and stash in their mattresses. 
And that by itself is a little bit scary. The bank's deposits are depleted. 
"But remember, they have a fractional reserve banking system. "
They do not expect everyone to show up on one day and expect all of their deposits to be accessible. 
So this is essentially going to lead to a run on banks. 
"And you're already starting to see this in Greece, and it is actually rational behaviour. "
"If you think that 30% of your savings is about to swiped away because of this thing right here, "
"I'm going to give you .7 of a euro for every euro you have, "
you would rationally go to the bank and get your deposit back. 
"But because everyone is going to start doing that, the banks won't have their reserves. "
The Greeks don't have their own central bank that can back up the banking system there. 
So this might lead to massive bank failures. 
"And essentially, the entire Greek banking sector could go down because of this. "
"And they don't have an independent central bank, independent of the European central bank, "
to kind of fight the fires the way that the Fed would in the US. 
So this is not a clean situation; it is not a painless situation. 
"But, outside any help, it seems like the only option that Greece has at this point. "

heart disease and heart failure and all of the rest. So let's say this is an artery 
and the blood is flowing in that direction... and let's say this right here is an artery. 
"Now, let me draw a plaque there. and we've been studying plaque since the video on heart attacks. "
So let's say this is a clump of white blood cells and lipid materials and all the rest 
"Now, a word that you might hear in a medical context is ""stenosis"", and the word "
"just refers to the narrowing, usually of a blood vessel. So, this right here, this blood vessel has been narrowed. "
"It can also refer to the narrowing of any type of tubular structure, so if you have "
"any type of pipe in a biological system, you can use stenosis there, but usually they're "
"talking about a blood vessel. In this example here, it's an artery. "
"Now, once the blood vessel is narrowed, that restricts the blood supply "
"so you aren't able to get as much blood through it, so the blood supply "
is restricted. This restriction of blood supply that usually leads to some loss of function 
"is called 'ischemia', another fancy word, that literally just means 'restricted blood supply'. "
"Now if you have stenosis in one of your blood vessels, and it leads to ischemia "
"then the muscles, and let's just say this a coronary artery here... "
the muscle cells over here are going to get less oxygen. 
So this muscle cell over here is not going to get enough oxygen -- and this is an oversimplified diagram 
"And, this is not what an actual muscle cell looks like. But I don't want to get into detail here... "
"But, this guy is not going to get enough oxygen. So, you can imagine that if we're really zoomed in on the surface of the heart "
"and we're looking at the cardiac muscle tissue, if this person with this heart needed to go jogging "
"and this cardiac muscle cell needed oxygen, they probably wouldn't be able to get the needed oxygen "
because of the stenosis which caused ischemia. 
"And because of that, this cell won't be able to help the heart pump properly "
"So this is going to lead to heart failure, and once again the word heart failure "
sounds more dramatic than it really is. It sounds like the heart stops (cardiac arrest) 
but it's really just saying that the heart is failing to PROPERLY do it's function -- not entirely shutting down. 
"So when this guy is jogging, because he has restricted blood supply "
because the heart is experiencing ischemia downstream from 
"this stenosis, that's why there's heart failure -- so not able to deliver "
"Now, this heart failure which is due to the ischemia and the stenosis "
you would call this heart failure due to 'Coronary Artery Disease' 
which is really just kind of an impairing of the heart's function 
"because of reduced blood supply, because of narrowing of the blood vessels "
"that is Coronary Artery Disease, and because of this disease "
when this muscle cell in the heart really needs to pump hard 
maybe because someone's going up a hill or climbing stairs 
it won't be able to do it because it's not getting enough oxygen. 
"Now, that inability to properly pump -- not just the cell, but the whole heart -- that is heart failure. "
Now you've probably the heard the term 'Coronary Heart Disease' 
or maybe just 'Heart Disease'... these three things are all the SAME thing. 
"They all imply some sort of narrowing, or stenosis, of arteries that leads "
"to ischemia, reduced blood flow, so that the heart can't function "
as well as it otherwise could. Now the last thing I want to focus on 
"and I talked a little bit in the last video, is the idea of an infarct or infarction. "
"These are kind of... funny words to say, so I'll right it over here "
"So, an infarct or infarction... now, in the example I've drawn so far "
"this cell maybe doesn't get enough oxygen, especially when the person is going up stairs and all of that, "
to properly contract the heart and pump blood. But this cell is not dead. 
It's still getting some base level oxygen -- less because of the stenosis and ischemia 
but it still gets some oxygen. Now we saw on the video on myocardial infarctions 
"or heart attacks that sometimes, one of these plaques might become "
unstable and they break off and then you have a complete blocking 
"of a vessel, and we called this -- if it's an embolus... "
and remember that an embolus is something that is just floating around 
"and eventually blocks a vessel, and if it was a due to a ruptured "
"plaque that also had clotting factors around it when it was released, "
then we would call this a thromboembolism. 
"And this would reduce the blood flow so much, that the cells downstream "
from this location actually die 
"because it's not even getting enough blood, not enough oxygen, to survive "
"and when you have dead tissue that's due to a loss of oxygen, this is an infarct. "
The process of it becoming dead tissue due to a loss of oxygen 
"is an infarction. When this infarction occurs in the muscle tissue of the heart, this is a heart attack "
This is a myocardial infarction... so hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.

"to us is Andromeda right over here, and this distance right over here and now were going to start talking"
"in the millions of light years so this distance right here is 2.5 million, 2.5 millon light years just"
as a bit of reference if that's any reference at all 1 light year is roughly the radius of the Oort cloud
"and the Oort cloud was, or another way to think about it, the Oort cloud or one radius of the Oort cloud"
"is about 50 or 60 thousand astronomical units and that's the distance from the Sun to the Earth, so you could view"
"this as 2.5 million times 60,000 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth so this is an unbelievably"
large distance we're talking about here and that's to get to the next big galaxy over here
"but even these things are huge things with many, i mean just unfathomably many stars, but Andromeda in"

its about 4 lightyears across if you go point to point if you go from one side to the other side

"4 light years is just the distance from us to the Alpha Centauri, so that's nothing,"
"that would only take Voyager 1 80,000 years to get to."
"This is 4 million light years, so 4 million times the distance to the nearest star."
"But even this, even this is... I'm starting to stumble on my words, there are no words to describe this,"
"even this is small on an intergalactic scale,"
"because when you zoom out more, you can see our local group - it's right over here"
"and this right over here is the Virgo Supercluster,"
"and each dot here is at least one galaxy, but it might be more than one galaxy,"
and the diameter here is 150 million... 150 million light years.
"So what we so in the local group in the last diagram, the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda,"
"which was 2.5 million light years, which would be just this litte dot,"
"just like that, that would be the distance between the Milky Way and the Andromeda."

"but we're not done yet, we can zoom out even more! We can zoom out even more... and over here,"
"right here, 150 million light years across, that would fit right about here, on this diagram."
"So this is all of the superclusters that are near us, and once again, near has to be used very loosely,"

"We're told that Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. "
"So, Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. Peter is four years old. "
"Peter is four years old, and Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. "
"So, Jared is twice Peter's age of four. "
And then they tell us Talia's age is 3 times Jared's age. 
How old are Talia and Jared? 
So Talia's age is 3 times Jared's age. 
So let's write this down. We have Peter is four years old. 
"So Peter- Peter's age- Peter's age,he's four years old. "
"Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. "
So Jared-Let me do that in yellow-So Jared- That's not yellow. 
Jared- Jared is twice the age of his brother. 
"So twice- twice is the same thing as two times, two times the age of his brother. "
We could-though- You could say Jared is twice the age of his brother. 
Or Jared is two times the age of his brother. 
"Well, his brother is four;they told us that right over there. "
So Jared is going to be two times four years old. 
"Two times four years old and if you know your multiplication tables, "
You know that's the same thing as eight. Two times four is eight. 
Four times two is eight or you know this is the same thing as Peter's age twice. 
Which is the same thing as four plus four. That would also get you eight. 
So this would give you- so Jared's age is equal to eight. 
And then finally they say Talia's age- let me write Talia's- Talia 
right over here. Talia's age and they say it- they tell it to us right over here. 
It's three times Jared's age. So Talia's age is three times Jared's age. 
Well we were able to figure out Jared's age. it is eight. 
It is three times Jared's age. 
If you know your multiplication tables this should maybe jump out at you. 
And your multiplication tables really are one of those things in mathmatics 
"That you should just, just really just know back and forth, "
"Just because it will make the rest of your life very, very, very simple, "
But or you could do three times eight as literally eight three times. 
So it's eight plus eight plus eight. Eight plus eight is sixteen. 
Sixteen plus eight is twenty-four. So three times eight is twenty-four. 
"So Peter is four, Jared is eight, and Talia is twenty-four. "

"And if it's tails, the switch is off. "
"In the other room, a woman switches her lights "
based on a blind guess. 
She tries to simulate randomness without a coin. 
Then we start the clock 
and they make their switches in unison. 
Can you determine which light bulb 
is being switched by a coin flip? 
The answer is Yes. 
But how? 
And the trick is to think about properties of the sequence 
rather than looking for any specific pattern. 
"For example, first we may try "
to count the number of 1's and 0's 
which occur in each sequence. 
"This is close, but not enough "
since they were both seen fairly even. 
The answer is to count sequences of numbers 
such as runs of three consecutive switches 
A true random sequence would be equally likely 
to contain every sequence of any length 
This is called the frequency stability property 
and its demonstrated by this uniform graph. 
The forgery is now obvious. 
Humans favour certain sequences when they make guesses 
"resulting in uneven pattern, such as we see here. "
One reason this happens 
is that we make mistake thinking that 
certain outcomes are less random than others. 
"But realize, there is no such thing as a lucky number. "
There is no such thing as a lucky sequence. 
"If we flip a coin 10 times, it is equaly likely to come up "
"all heads, all tails, or any other sequence you can think of. "
Consider the following:
"Imagine two rooms,"
inside each room is a switch
In one room there is a man who flips his switch
according to a coin flip.
"If it's heads, that signals that the switch is on --"

"One of you all sent a fairly interesting problem, so I"
"The problem is I have a group of 30 people, so"
30 people in a room.
And the question is what is the probability that at least 2
people have the same birthday?
This is kind of a fun question because that's the size
of a lot of classrooms.
What's the probability that at least someone in the classroom
shares a birthday with someone else in the classroom?
That's a good way to phrase as well.
"This is the same thing as saying, what is the probability"
that someone shares with at least someone else.
They could share it with 2 other people or 4 other
And at first this problem seems really hard because there's
a lot of circumstances that makes this true.
I could have exactly 2 people have the same birthday.
I could have exactly 3 people have the same birthday.
I could have exactly 29 people have the same birthday and all
"of these make this true, so do I add the probability of each"
of those circumstances?
And then add them up and then that becomes really hard.
"And then I would have to say, OK, whose birthdays"
and I comparing?
And I would have to do combinations.
It becomes a really difficult problem unless you make kind
of one very simplifying take on the problem.
This is the opposite of-- well let me draw the
probability space.
Let's say that this is all of the outcomes.
Let me draw it with a thicker line.
We want to know-- let me draw it in a color that won't
be offensive to you.
"That doesn't look that great, but anyway."
"Let's say that this is the probability, this area right"
"here-- and I don't know how big it really is,"
we'll figure it out.
Let's say that this is the probability that someone
shares a birthday with at least someone else.
What's this area over here?
What's this green area?
"Well, that means if these are all the cases where someone"
"shares a birthday with someone else, these are all the area"
This is what we're trying to figure out.
I'll just call it the probability that
someone shares.
"I'll call it the probability of sharing, probability of s."
This is going to be 1 minus p of s.
Or if we said that this is the probability-- or another way we
"could say it, actually this is the best way to think about it."
This is the probability that all 30 people have
30 different birthdays.
No one shares with anyone.
The probability that someone shares with someone else plus
the probability that no one shares with anyone-- they all
have distinct birthdays-- that's got to be equal to 1.
Because we're either going to be in this situation or we're
going to be in that situation.
Or you can say they're equal to 100%.
"Either way, 100% and 1 are the same number."
It's equal to 100%.
So if we figure out the probability that everyone has
the same birthday we could subtract it from 100.
So let's see.
We could we just rewrite this.
The probability that someone shares a birthday with someone
"else, that's equal to 100% minus the probability that"
"everyone has distinct, separate birthdays."
And the reason why I'm doing that is because as I started
"off in the video, this is kind of hard to figure out."
"You know, I can figure out the probability that 2 people have"
"the same birthday, 5 people, and it becomes very confusing."
"But here, if I wanted to just figure out the probability that"
"everyone has a distinct birthday, it's actually a much"
easier probability to solve for.
So what's the probability that everyone has a
distinct birthday?
Person one.
"Just for simplicity, let's imagine the case that we only"
have 2 people in the room.
What's the probably that they have different birthdays?
"Let's see, person one, their birthday could be 365 days"
out of 365 days of the year.
"You know, whenever their birthday is."
"And then person two, if we wanted to ensure that they"
"don't have the same birthday, how many days could"
person two be born on?
"Well, it could be born on any day that person"
So there are 364 possibilities out 365.
"So if you had 2 people, the probability that no one"
is born on the same birthday-- this is just 1.
It's just going to be equal to 364/365.
Now what happens if we had 3 people?
So first of all the first person could
be born on any day.
Then the second person could be born on 364 possible
days out of 365.
"And then the third person, what's the probability that"
the third person isn't born on either of these
people birthdays?
"So 2 days are taken up, so the probability is 363/365."
You get 365 times 36-- actually I should rewrite this one.
"Instead of saying this is 1, let me write this as-- the"
numerator is 365 times 364 over 365 squared.
Because I want you to see the pattern.
Here the probability is 365 times 364 times 363 over
365 to the third power.
"And so, in general, if you just kept doing this to 30, if I"
just kept this process for 30 people-- the probability that
And you can just type this into your calculator right now.
"It'll take you a little time to type in 30 numbers, and you'll"
get the probability that no one shares the same birthday
But before we do that let me just show you something
that might make it a little bit easier.
Is there any way that I can mathematically express
this with factorials?
Or that I could mathematically express this with factorials?
Let's think about it.
365 factorial is what?
365 factorial is equal to 365 times 364 times 363 times--
all the way down to 1.
You just keep multiplying.
It's a huge number.
"Now, if I just want the 365 times the 364 in this case,"
I have to get rid of all of these numbers back here.
One thing I could do is I could divide this thing
by all of these numbers.
So 363 times 362-- all the way down to 1.
So that's the same thing as dividing by 363 factorial.
365 factorial divided by 363 factorial is essentially this
because all of these terms cancel out.
So this is equal to 365 factorial over 363 factorial
over 365 squared.
"And of course, for this case, it's almost silly to worry"
"about the factorials, but it becomes useful once we have"
something larger than two terms up here.
"So by the same logic, this right here is going to be equal"
to 365 factorial over 362 factorial over 365 squared.
"And actually, just another interesting point."
How did we get this 365?
"Sorry, how did we get this 363 factorial?"
"Well, 365 minus 2 is 363, right?"
And that makes sense because we only wanted two terms up here.
We only wanted two terms right here.
So we wanted to divide by a factorial that's two less.
And so we'd only get the highest two terms left.
This is also equal to-- you could write this as 365
factorial divided by 365 minus 2 factorial 365 minus 2 is 363
factorial and then you just end up with those two terms
and that's that there.
"And then likewise, this right here, this numerator you could"
rewrite as 365 factorial divided by 365 minus 3-- and
we had 3 people-- factorial.
"And that should hopefully make sense, right?"
This is the same thing as 365 factorial-- well 365 divided
by 3 is 362 factorial.
And so that's equal to 365 times 364 times
363 all the way down.
Divided by 362 times all the way down.
And that'll cancel out with everything else and you'd
be just left with that.
And that's that right there.
"So by that same logic, this top part here can be written as"
365 factorial over what?
365 minus 30 factorial.
And I did all of that just so I could show you kind of the
pattern and because this is frankly easier to type into a
calculator if you know where the factorial button is.
So let's figure out what this entire probability is.
do the numerator.
"365 factorial divided by-- well, what's 365 minus 30?"
That's 335.
Divided by 335 factorial and that's the whole numerator.
And now we want to divide the numerator by 365
to the 30th power.
Let the calculator think and we get 0.2936.
Equals 0.2936.
"Actually 37 if you rounded, which is equal to 29.37%."
"Now, just so you remember what we were doing all along, this"
was the probability that no one shares a birthday with anyone.
"This was the probability of everyone having distinct,"
different birthdays from everyone else.
"And we said, well, the probability that someone shares"
"a birthday with someone else, or maybe more than one person,"
is equal to all of the possibilities-- kind of the
"100%, the probability space, minus the probability that no"
one shares a birthday with anybody.
So that's equal to 100% minus 29.37%.
"Or another way you could write it as that's 1 minus 0.2937,"
which is equal to-- so if I want to subtract that from 1.
1 minus-- that just means the answer.
That means 1 minus 0.29.
You get 0.7063.
Which is kind of a neat result because if you have 30 people
"in a room you might say, oh wow, what are the odds"
that someone has the same birthday as someone else?
It's actually pretty high.
"70% of the time, if you have a group of 30 people, at least 1"
person shares a birthday with at least one other
person in the room.
So that's kind of a neat problem.
And kind of a neat result at the same time.

I went to college. I went to University of Missouri-Rolla initially.

But I went away from political science because I realized

The whole point of the immune system is to keep out shady
"things from your body-- or, if they get in, to kill them."
So those shady things would include shady proteins that
"can do damage to your body, viruses, bacteria, even"
"eukaryotic parasites, and then even fungi."
"So all sorts of things that if they were to enter your body,"
they would cause some form of disease.
These are collectively called pathogens.
"So the whole point of the immune system is, on a first"
"line of defense, keep these things out-- and then if they"
"were to get into your body, to kill and eliminate them from"
our system so that we don't get sick and so
that we don't die.
So I already just mentioned that there's kind of two lines
"of defense and even with those, there's kind of"
The first line of defense-- I'll just call that the first
line-- which is essentially just to keep things out-- keep
all of these pathogens out.
And there's some obvious ones.
There's our skin.
Our skin keeps pathogens out and actually even the oils on
our skin are a little bit more acidic and it's hard for some
types of bacteria to thrive in that type of environment.
"You have your mucus membranes and in the mucous, there's"
there's some chemicals that maybe make it a little bit
more difficult for bacteria to survive.
And then you even have acidic environments like
"You might not view your stomach as the outside of you,"
but it fundamentally is.
"Your whole digestive tract, which I'll make videos on in"
"the near future, is really on the outside of you."
You can simply model really most vertebrate bodies as kind
of a doughnut our digestive tract is the
So stomach acid is on the outside of our real bodies and
"you can imagine, that's a hard environment for a lot of these"
pathogens to survive in.
"So that's the first line of defense, but we know that"
"that's not good enough, that sometimes these things can get"
"into our bodies, and there we have to start thinking about"
the second line of defense.
What do we do once things are actually in our body?
"And here, in both the first and second line, I'm talking"
about non-specific immunity-- and this is going to make a
lot of sense when we start talking about specific
immunities.
So both of these are non-specific.
And when I say non-specific-- or you can also call them
innate-- it means that they just generally respond to
things that appear bad.
They don't remember the bad things that came before.
They don't respond to a particular type of virus or a
"particular-- well, they do respond to every type of virus"
"or every type of bacteria, but they don't say, this is virus"
"type A, B, C, or this is bacteria type A, B, C."
"They just say, this is a virus."
"Let me get rid of it, or let me not let it in."
This is a bacteria.
Let me get rid of it or let me not let it in.
It doesn't know what type of bacteria it's dealing with.
So this is all the non-specific or
innate immune system.
And we'll go into a lot of detail on the specific immune
"system because you can imagine, it becomes very"
complicated or interesting when you start thinking about
your body somehow remembering a virus that it's seen before
and being able to respond better to that virus or that
bacteria or that protein the second time it sees it.
So we're dealing with non-specific in this case.
"And the the second line of your non-specific immunity,"
there are two things.
One is an inflammatory response.
"And I'm going to do a whole video on this, but in general,"
we've all experienced inflammatory responses.
When you see blood flowing to a certain part of an area and
you see there's pus and there's-- and I'm going to go
"actually is, but that's one of your-- and what it really is"
doing is bringing blood and bringing cells that can fight
whatever type of infection you have. It's bringing them to
the site where maybe you got a cut or maybe where a lot of
the bacteria or whatever the pathogen is.
So inflammatory response is all about bringing fluid and
I'm going to do a whole video on that.
"But the byproduct is, that part of your tissue or that"
part of you body gets inflamed-- a lot of fluid
"there, a lot of byproducts of the battle that goes on there."
We'll do a whole video on that.
"And the other second line of defense is, and it's actually"
part of the inflammatory response-- are phagocytosis or
phagocytes.
"And really, what I want to do over the rest of this video is"
talk in a little bit more detail about phagocytes
"because once we understand what phagocytes do, that's a"
pretty good building block for going into the specific immune
"system-- and actually, it'll help lead into the discussion"
on the inflammatory response as well because phagocytes are
really part of the inflammatory response.
So phagocytes are just a class of cell
that can eat up pathogens.
"They can eat up other things really, but when we talk about"
"the immune system, we're talking about pathogens."
So let's say that this is a phagocyte right here.
"It has some kind of a nucleus, whatever."
I don't have to focus on the inside of the phagocyte.
"It's a traditional eukaryotic cell, but what I want to do is"
see what happens when a phagocyte encounters a foreign
particle or a foreign bacteria.
So let me say this is a foreign bacteria right here.
"So the phagocyte, we've already said, is non-specific."
"What it does is, it has receptors that respond to just"
things that it knows are bad.
You could imagine these are super sensors.
Maybe these are super sensors for bacteria.
The bacteria have proteins on their surface that maybe look
something like that.
Obviously they don't look exactly like that.
I'm just drawing them as kind of a Y and a triangle so you
But once these two guys connect-- let me draw the
situation where they have connected.
So this is the bacteria.
This is the pathogen.
And it's really the same idea with a virus or any
other type of thing.
And we'll actually see in future videos that these guys
"can actually be tagged by other molecules, which makes"
these phagocytes want to attack them even more.
"Once they're bonded-- that's my bacteria,"
the invading pathogen.
And now it is bonded.
It has triggered the receptor on this phagocyte.
This phagocyte will start to engulf-- it'll wrap around
this pathogen.
And these two ends are eventually going to meet.
"But then once these two meet, what's it going to look like?"
"Then all of a sudden, that bacteria is going to be"
completely engulfed.
It's going to be inside of the cell.
So now the cell-- once these two ends meet and these
"membranes merge, then this guy is going to be in his own"
"little membrane bubble-- or you can almost imagine, it's"
in its own little vesicle.
"So this is the pathogen, the bacteria in this case-- but"
phagocytosis-- the process is completely identical in terms
of how it engulfs things.
If it was a virus or some type of other foreign protein or
"any type of really foreign molecule-- actually, sometimes"
it doesn't even occur to foreign stuff.
It can occur to dying molecules that are not
"foreign, that just need to be cleared out."
"But we'll just focus on the immune system, on foreign"
things right now.
So this membrane right here will completely merge and go
around this guy like this.
"And of course, you had your receptors and who knows if"
they're still there.
By the time-- let's just draw them there so you see that
that part is that part.
"But once it's fully engulfed, this thing is called a"
"phagosome, which is really just a vesicle that contains"
that foreign particle that you want to get rid of.
And then other fluid or vesicles that contain things
that can eat up this phagosome-- so let's say that
this is some vesicle that contains things-- lysozymes
and it contains really reactive species of oxygen.
"And if this comes in contact with, really, almost any"
"biological compound, it's going to do some damage."
"But once the pathogen is completely merged inside the cell,"
this little package will merge over here and it will
"dump its contents into this phagosome, into this vesicle"
"containing the pathogen, and then break it up."
It's essentially digesting it.
"So obviously the first role is, it just got it out of the"
way and it killed it.
And then the second role-- and I'm just going to give a
little tidbit right here.
We're going to do it in a lot more detail in future videos.
It breaks it up.
So now the thing is all broken up.
another molecules.
And then what the phagocyte does-- it'll actually take
"some subset of these molecules, some"
subset of the proteins.
Proteins are just sequences of amino acids.
"Normally when people say proteins, they're talking"
about long sequences of amino acids.
When people talk about short sequences of amino acids or a
peptide chain.
A peptide chain is a shorter chain of amino acids.
"So this guy will take some special peptide chains, some"
"special pieces from the thing it just killed, attach them to"
some other proteins.
So it'll take maybe a little piece of this bacteria right
"now, attach it to other protein, which is called a"
major histocompatibility complex-- and if we're talking
"about phagocytes, this will be a major histocompatibility"
complex type II.
"It sounds very-- a strange word, but we're going to see"
this a lot.
This is a protein and it bonds with this peptide that was
pathogen and then this phagocyte will then present it
onto its membrane.
So this combination-- the complex of the MHC-- in this
"case, it's going to be an MHC II protein."
We're going to talk about Type I. in the future.
It's going to take this complex and then present it on
its surface.
And the reason why I'm going through all this pain of
"explaining this process-- you're like, hey, we already"
got rid of the thing and killed it.
Why is Sal worried about what we do with the peptides?
This is crucial to our immune system because we'll see other
specific parts of our immune system.
"Remember, so far everything is non-specific."
"This guy just said, this is an invader."
It doesn't know the type of an invader.
"It just says, hey, let me bond to this thing and kill it."
It's one of these things that I know are foreign to my body.
"So it kills it, but now it can leave it on its surface and"
"now the specific parts, the parts that actually have"
"memory and attack specific things, can say, gee, Mr."
"Phagocyte, look, you've killed something."
Let me see if I have some specific reactions that can be
triggered by this thing that you're presenting.
"So, many phagocytes are also called"
antigen presenting cells.
And I'm going to go into more detail on what exactly an
antigen is.
I called this thing a pathogen.
An antigen is essentially-- you can view it as a protein
or a peptide chain that will trigger or that can be dealt
with within the immune system.
I'll be a little bit-- the specific immune system.
And I'm going to be a little bit more nuanced about it when
I talk-- I'll make a whole video on antigens and
"antibodies, but right now you can just view it as a peptide"
chain right there.
An antigen is just a protein or part of a protein.
So this is presenting an antigen on its surface that
can later be used by other parts.
"Now, the one thing that-- there are many, many types of"
phagocytes.
"And just to give you-- just so when you see different words,"
you don't get confused by the different types of phagocytes.
I'll do a little review of those right now.
You have neutrophils.
These are actually the most common of the phagocytes.
And these are the fast and numerous respondors.
So these get to a location of infection very fast.
Phagocytes don't necessarily just have to kill in this way.
"I mean, they're called phagocytes because they engulf"
"this way, but we'll in future videos talk about other ways"
that they can release chemicals or even DNA nets to
"ensnare pathogens, but neutrophils"
are fast and abundant.
"And then you have macrophages, which are-- on some level,"
"they're the most versatile and do the heavy lifting, but"
they're also phagocytes.
And then you dendritic cells.
"And when you first see the word dendritic cell, you"
"think, hey, does this somehow relate to dendrites of the"
nervous system?
"And no, they have nothing to do with the nervous system."
The reason why they're called dendritic cells is because
they look like they have dendrites.
"So they look like neurons on some level, but they don't"
participate in the nervous system at all.
And these tend to be the best activators of the specific
immune system that we'll talk about in future videos.
"So anyway, I'll leave you there and we'll talk more"
about all of this in the next few videos.

"We are asked to simplify a log base 5 of 25 to the ""x"" power over ""y"""
That this having this right over here inside of the logarithm is not a pleasant way to look at it
So the first thing that we realize is that this is one of our logarithm properties
"So logarithm for a given base so lets say that the base is ""x"" of a/b"
"That is equal to log base ""x"" of a minus log base ""x"" of b"
"Now here we have 25 to the ""x"" over y"
So we can simplify
Now this looks like we can do a little bit of simplifying
"That's the same thing as b times log base ""x"" of a"
"So this part right over here can be written as ""x"" times the logarithm of base 5"
"of 25 and then of course we have minus log base 5 of ""y"""
This part right here is asking us what power
do I have to raise 5 to to get to 25
""
We're asked to find the conjugate of the complex number 
seven minus five i. 
And what you're going to find in this video is 
finding the conjugate of a complex number is 
shockingly easy. 
"It's really the same as this number, I should say "
- be a little bit more particular- 
"It has the same real parts, so the conjugate of this "
"is going to have the exact same real part, "
but its imaginary part is going to have the opposite sign. 
"So, instead of having a negative five i, it will have "
a positive - a positive- 5 i. 
So that right there is the complex conjugate of 
seven minus five i. 
And some times the notation for doing it that is 
-you'll take seven minus five i- 
"If you have seven minus five i, "
"and you put a line over it like that, "
that means you want the conjugate 
of seven minus five i. 
And that will equal seven plus five i. 
"Or sometimes someone will write, "
-you'll see z is the variable people often use for complex numbers- 
"if z is seven minus five i, "
"then they'll say complex conjugate of z, "
-you put that line over the z- 
is going to be seven plus five i. 
"Now you're probably saying ok, fairly straightforward "
"to find a conjugate of a complex number, "
but what is it good for? 
"And the simplest reason, or the most basic place "
"where this is useful is when you multiply any imaginary, "
"any complex number times its conjugate, you're going to get a real number. "
"And I want to emphasize, "
"this right here is the conjugate seven plus five, "
is the conjugate of seven minus five i. 
But seven minus five i is also the conjugate 
"of seven plus five i, for obvious reasons. "
"If you started with this, and changed the sign "
"of the imaginary part, you would get seven minus five i. "
They're conjugates of each other. 
"But let me show you when I multiply complex conjugates, "
that I get a real number. 
So lets multiply seven minus five i times seven plus five i. 
And I will do that in blue. 
Seven minus five i times seven plus five i. 
"And remember, whenever you multiply these expressions, "
you really just have to multiply every term times each other. 
You could do the distributive property twice. 
"You could do something like foil, to remind yourself "
every part of this complex number times 
every part of this complex number. 
So let's just do it any which way. 
"So you have seven times seven, which is forty-nine. "
"Seven times five i, which is thirty-five i. "
"Then you have negative five i times seven, "
which is negative thirty-five i. 
You can see the imaginary part is canceling out. 
Then you have negative five i time positive five i. 
Well that's negative twenty-five i-squared. 
"And negative twenty-five i-squared, "
-remember i-squared is negative one- 
"So negative twenty five i-squared, "
-let me write this down- 
"negative five i, times five i, is negative twenty-five times i-squared. "
"i-squared is negative one, so negative twenty-five times negative one "
is positive twenty-five. 
"And these two guys over here cancel out, "
and we're just left with forty-nine plus twenty-five. 
"Let's see, fifty plus twenty-five is seventy-five. "
"So, this is just seventy-four. "
"So, we are just left with the real number seventy-four. "
"Another way to do it, "
-you don't even have to do all this distributive property- 
You might just recognize this looks like. 
This is something plus something times 
-or something minus something- 
times that same thing plus something. 
And we know this pattern from our early algebra. 
That a plus b -a plus b- times a minus b 
is equal to a-squared minus b-squared. 
Is equal to a diference of squares. 
"And so in this case a is seven, a-squared is forty-nine. "
"And b, b in this case is five i. "
"b-squared is five i-squared, which twenty-five i-squared, "
"which is negative twenty-five, and we're subtracting that. "
So it's going to be positive plus-twenty-five. 
"You add 'em together, you get seventy-four. "
""
I've been requested to do some problems on critical points and
"maxima, minima, and concavity, so I will do some problems."
So these were sent to me by [? Akosh ?].
I don't know where he is but these are interesting problems
"and I haven't done anything like these before, so I thought"
I would do the exact problem he's given.
And they say f of x is equal to x squared plus 4x plus 4.
"And the interval that they care about is from minus 4, and"
including minus 4-- that's why we have the brackets
there-- to 0.
"And just so you know, this interval notation, if it was"
"written like this with parentheses, it would mean all"
"the numbers between minus 4 and 0, but not including them."
"This is a closed interval, so you're including minus"
4 and you're including 0.
This is called an open interval.
"But anyway you can ignore this, because that's not"
what was in the problem.
So the first thing they ask is what are the critical points.
"And different people use different terminology, but my"
"So it's the points where the derivatives equal to 0, or the"
derivative just doesn't exist.
"But as we see in this interval, we'll stick to the derivative."
f prime of x is equal to 2x plus 4.
So why does this equal to 0?
Let's see.
2x is equal to minus 4.
x is equal to minus 2.
"When x is equal to minus 2, what is f of minus 2?"
So we know that f prime of minus 2 is equal 0.
We just solved for that.
So we know the slope is 0 at that point.
But I just want to know what the coordinate point is.
"And then plus 4, so f of minus 4 is 4."
And then what's f of 0?
"f of 0 is equal to-- well that's 0 0, that's equal to 4."
So now we could graph this.
Let me graph the difference.
"So if this is the x-axis and that is the y-axis, and the"
interval that we care about is from x is equal to minus 4.
From minus 4 to 0.
Well the critical points were when the slope is equal to 0.
"And that's when f is equal to minus 2, and that happens at"
"the point minus 2,0, so it's right here, which is directly"
in between those two points incidentally.
Which is a good intuition behind why these two values are
"equal, because this is a parabola and it's symmetric, so"
"But anyway, ignore that if it confused you."
So at minus 2 we have a negative slope.
So the graph is going to look something like this.
And I'll do it in another color.
"And since we only care about that interval, let's only"
It's going to look something like that.
want to know the maximum and the minimum point.
Well the minimum point is pretty clear.
It's this critical point right here where the derivative
was equal to 0.
And if you wanted to use you know whatever they call
But hopefully you have the intuition of why.
"If that's f prime of x, f prime of x for all x is equal to 2."
So really at any point you test you're going to get the second
derivative to be positive.
So especially at this critical point where the first
derivative is 0.
The second derivative being positive tells you that the
slope is constantly increasing.
"The slope is really negative there, little less negative,"
"goes to 0, and then keeps increasing, becomes more"
"positive, even more positive slope there."
And they want to know the maximum points.
the value x equals 0.
They're both maximum points.
They tie for first place.
What's the next problem they give?
confusing then the problem itself.
"So they give h of r is equal to 1/r, and they care about the"
interval-- I'm assuming from this interval on r-- from
"negative 1 to 3, and we're going to include negative 1 and"
3 because we have brackets.
Well what are the critical points?
"They're the points where either the derivative is 0, or the"
derivative doesn't exist.
We'll see in a second there's a point here where the derivative
So that's not a critical point.
"So as you're going to see in this problem, there is a point"
where the derivative is undefined but f of x-- or in
But anyway.
What's the derivative here?
h prime of r.
"Well that's r to the negative 1, right, so it becomes"
"negative r of the negative 2, or that's minus 1"
over r squared.
That's the derivative.
Can this ever equal 0?
"Well no, it's never going to be equal 0."
But where is it undefined?
Well it's undefined when r is equal to 0.
And r equal to 0 is in that interval.
"But h of 0 is also undefined, right?"
1/0 is undefined.
h of 0 also undefined.
So I'm not going to really consider that to be a
It's just a point at which the derivative and the
function is undefined.
And so what will the graph look like?
Well let's see if we can draw the interval.
And we might just want to draw some points.
I would just graph some points.
You can ever go wrong with that.
"Let's see, 1/r."
"So we want to go from negative 1 to 3, so we're going to"
have some negative values.
"this is the function of r, this is the h of r-axis."
So we're going to go from r is equal to negative
1 to r is equal to 3.
What is h of negative 1?
Well think about it.
"When r is negative 1/2, it goes to negative 2, and it's"
actually going to asymptote.
"It's going to asymptote to negative infinity, right, if I"
kept drawing this all the way down that would just asymptote.
And then what is h of 3.
Well h of 3 is just going to be 1/3.
It's going to be relatively low number.
And then what's going to happen as we get closer
and closer to 0?
"Well if you put a really small positive value here, you get"
larger and larger numbers.
"So this actually asymptotes to positive infinity, so it'll"
look something like this.
I always have trouble drawing these hyperbolas.
"So that goes to positive infinity, and this will on this"
side go to minus infinity.
"From the left hand side it approaches negative infinity,"
and 1/0 is just undefined.
either because the definition of the derivative means you're
And as we see the limit is not valid from
So what are the maximum and minimum points here?
"Well if we look at this value, we might say oh,"
is that a minimum point?
"Well no, because you have values much lower."
"And then you say, well is this a maximum point?"
"Well no, you have values that go to positive infinity"
"But this really has no maximum or minimum points, because"
the graph is undefined at 0.
"And then you know if I said, oh well what if I get really close"
to 0 and I called that the maximum point.
"Then you say, no, no, no, no, but there's a point even closer"
the maximum value.
"Anyway, I'm already at 11 minutes and people at YouTube"
"apparently let me go well past the limit now, but people told"
"me that they like the 10 minute nuggets of knowledge, so I will"
stop now and I'll continue these problems in
a future video.

We know that quadrilateral ABCD over here is a parallelogram.
And what I want to discuss in this video is a general way of finding the area of a parallelogram.
In the last video we talked about a particular way of finding a area of a rhombus.
You can take half the product of it's diagonals.
the product of the half the product of the diagonals of any parallelogram
It has to be a rhombus. So now were just going to talk about the parallelograms.
So what do we know about parallelograms?
Well we know the opposite sides are parallel.
And we also know that opposite sides are congruent.
So this length is equal to this length.
And this length is equal to this length over here.
We can split our parallelogram into two triangles.
We've proven this multiple times that these two triangles are congruent.
We can do it in a pretty straightforward way.
"We can look, obviously A,D is equal to B,C."
"We have D,C is equal to A,B."
And then both of these triangles share this third side right over here.
"They both share A,C."
"So CBA, triangle CBA."
And this is by Side Side Side (SSS) congruency.
"All three sides, they have three corresponding sides that are congruent to each other."
So the triangles are congruent to each other.
"So if I want to find the area, the area of ABCD, the whole parallelogram."
It's going to be equal to the area of triangle ADC plus the area of CBA.
But the area of CBA is the same thing as the area of ADC.
Because they are congruent by Side Side Side (SSS).
So this is just going to be two times the area of triangle ADC.
Which is convenient for us because we know how to find the areas of triangles.
The area of triangles is literally just one half times base times height.
So it's one half times base times height of this triangle.
And we are given the base of ADC.
It is this length right over here.
It is DC. You could view it as the base of the entire parallelogram.
"And if you wanted to figure out the height,"
we could draw an altitude down like this.
"So if you want the total area of parallelogram ABCD,"
It is equal to two times one half times base times height.
Well two times one half is just 1.
So thats a neat result and you might've guessed that this would be the case.
But if you want to find out the area of any parallelogram
and if you can figure out the height
"it is literally, you just take one of the bases because opposite sides are equal times the height."
So thats one way you could of found the area.
"Or you could've multiplied, the other way to think about it"
"Stand it on this side, so this would be point A"
This would be point D.
This would be point C.
And this would be point B.
Or you could say it's equal to AD times
I'll call this altitude right here h2.
Maybe I'll call this h1.
So you could take this base times this height.
This is h2. Either way.
Just to make things clear.
"So if someone were to give you a parallelogram like this,"
they were to tell you this is a parallelogram.
If they were to tell you this length right over here is 5.
And if they were to tell you that this distance is 6.
Then the area of this parallelogram would literally be 5 times 6.
I drew the altitude outside the parallelogram.
So the area of this parallelogram would be 30.

"Right, what I have right in front of me is the Khan Academy measuring angles, "
measuring angles exercise. I have a small part of it in this screen right over here. 
And it's a pretty cool exercise cause it has this little 
virtual protracter that we can use to actually measure angles. 
"And I wanna give credit to the, the person who built "
"this protracter, cause I think it's pretty neat. Omar Rizwan, "
"who's actually a high school interim made this, made this "
"pretty neat module. And so in general, when you wanna "
"measure an angle, what you wanna do is you wanna put the "
"center of your protracter at the center of well actually, "
"I said the vertex of the angle at the center of the protracter, "
"and then, what you wanna do is, either rotate the angle or rotate the protractor "
in this case you are going to rotate the protractor 
you wanna rotate the protracor so that the zero angle 
are look at the zero mark is at one of the sides 
of the angle and the other side of the angle is within the protractor 
"so lets,try to do that so if may be ,if you wanna do that "
this zero side it should be at this side of the angle 
"so lets,rotate it "
"lets rotate it that way, "
its keep rotating it 
i can keep it press thats better 
"alright ,thats looks about right so, "
"one side, is that zero mark and then my angle my other side "
are if there is a way 
points 2 looks like pretty cause to the 20˚ mark 
so i would type the range of the screen you are seeing that 
and that is the right answer 
and we can get the other angle 
"so lets,try the measure this one right over here "
"so,once again place the center of the protractor "
at the center at the vertex of an angle 
we can place the zero degree the base of the protractor at this side of the angle 
so we should rotate it a little bit 
"we want to do one more time that , looks about right "
and the angle is now opening up 
this is the other side of point to 110 degrees 
is this larger than 90 degree its also an obtuse angle. 
"the last one is an acute angle,this is obtuse "
"angle 110 degrees more than 90 degrees,we typed in "
i got the right answer 
just do couple of more than these 
"so,once again put the center the protractor at the vertex of an angle "
"now i want to rotate it ,there we go, and this looks liking roughly "
"an 80 degree angle but,if i am really precise "
81 or 82 degrees and 80 is my best guess 
lets do one more of these. Vertex of my angle 
at the center of my protractor.and I want to put one 
side of my angle at 0 degrees. here are two ways 
"to do this, you could do just this, this is not too "
helpful as the angle is outside the protractor. 
"So lets keep rotating it, so our other side points to "
"70 degrees, so it is an acute angle. "
I will leave you with that.

"In the last video, we saw that China had increased its M1 money supply "
from November of 2009 to November of 2010 by roughly 700 billion dollars. 
What I want to do in this video is compare that to increase in foreign assets. 
So we move up here once again. 
All of this data is straight from the website of the people's bank of China. 
And this is the URL right over here. 
And your can get from multiple years that have tons of other statistics. 
And so this chart tells us their foreign assets and foreign exchange. 
Now I'm just gonna to focus on foreign assets because when they print currency and say 
"with their printed yuan, they go buy dollars. "
"With that dollars we could buy, or they could keep it in dollars "
or they could buy treasury bonds or they could just go buy US assets. 
So assets are the best measure of what they are holding 
that is denominated in other currencies. 
So let's look at their growth from November of 2009 to November of 2010. 
This is why I pick November because we don't have December of 2010 in this chart. 
"So foreign assets, once again this is in hundred million yuan. "
"Foreign assets in November 2009, "
"183,651 and that's in hundred million yuan. "
"And you fast forward to November 2010, it is 212,733. "
So let's once again put that in terms that make a little more sense at least for someone who is used to dollars. 
So I will use a very rough approximation for the US. 
"Yuan exchanges in last years, that's close to 6.58 now. "
But it gets to about 700 billion dollars increase in money supply 
that we get in last video. So let's check this out. 
"So we end up at 212,733 hundred million yuan in foreign assets "
"November 2010 minus 183,651 so that is the difference. "
And this is in hundred million yuan. So let's multiply by a hundred. 
"So this will be million yuan. Now we divide this by 1,000. This will give us billion yuan. "
It's actually close to 2900 billion yuan. So it's almost 3 trillion yuan. 
"If we want to convert this into dollar, I should choose the same 6.5. "
I can do 6.58. Let me just do 6.58. So divide it by 6.58 to put it into billions of US dollars. 
So you see there is a 440 billion increase in foreign assets when demoninated in dollars. 
"So let's think about that. Let's think about this. M1 from November 2009 to November 2010, "
"M1 was up by approximately 700 billion dollars, "
"and foreign assets were up approximately, what was the number I just typed there? "
Approximately 440 billion. 
"So most the expansion of the monetary base, of their M1 base, "
was to go out to buy foreign assets over the course of 2010. 
And the balances really just kind of support the growth of actual Chinese economy 
with most of it is to go out there buy foreign assets in other currencies. 
And actually help keep the yuan devalued. This is Salman Khan of the Khan Academy for CNBC.

"We're asked to subtract, simplify the answer and write"
as a mixed number.
"So we have two mixed numbers here, and like when you're"
"adding mixed numbers, you can do it two ways."
You can either turn both of these into improper fractions
"and then subtract, or you can subtract the whole number part"
"and then the fraction part, so let's do it that way."
"So just to remind ourselves, 5 and 5/8 is the exact same thing"
Let me write it here in yellow.
as 5 plus 5/8. These are the exact same thing.
And subtracting-- let me write this subtraction sign in blue--
"and then we're subtracting 2 and 1/5, but 2"
and 1/5 is the exact same thing as 2 plus 1/5.
That's what 2 and 1/5 really is.
"Now if we're subtracting, that means we have to subtract 2"
Distributive property.
We're subtracting both of them.
"So we get 5 plus 5/8, and then we distribute the negative sign,"
"as 5 minus 2, that's the whole number parts, and"
then you have plus 5/8 minus 1/5.
That's just 3.
But what's 5/8 minus 1/5?
Let's do that over here.
So we have 5/8 minus 1/5.
"Now, just like when you're adding fractions, when you're"
"subtracting fractions, you have to have a common denominator."
8 and 5 are not the same denominator so we have to find
the least common multiple of these two numbers.
"If we do a prime factorization of 8, you get 2 times 4."
4 is 2 times 2.
So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.
That's if you break it down into its constituent primes.
"5 is just 5, because it is a prime number."
So the least common multiple of 8 and 5 has to have a 5 and
three 2's in it.
"Or another way of saying it, it has to be 5 times 2 times 2"
"times 2, which is the same thing as 5 times 8."
So the least common multiple is going to be-- because these
guys share no common factors other than 1 really.
The least common multiple is just going to be 8 times 5.
So the least common multiple is going to be 40.
It's going to be 40.
"Now, to go from 8 to 40, you have to multiply by 5."
Then we have to do the same thing to the numerator.
"If we multiplied 8 times 5, we have to multiply 5 times 5 to get 25."
"also have to do that for the numerator, so 1 times 8 is 8."
"So now we have 25/40 minus 40/40, which would be equal"
to-- we're going to have 40 as the denominator.
25 minus 8 is 17.
"So 5/8 minus 1/5, which is the same thing as 25/40 minus"
"8/40, is equal to 17/40."
And 17 is a prime number so it's not going to share any
"common factors with 40, or at least 40 isn't divisible by 17"
"either, so this is as simplified as we can get."
"So this part, the [integer] part, is 3 and the fraction"
part is 17/40. And we're done
And this worked.
We were able to separate this out and do it pretty
"straightforward, because in this situation, the fraction"
part that we're subtracting from the other fraction part was smaller.
"If it was larger, it would've gotten a little bit messy."
Maybe we would have ended up with a negative number and we
"would've done all this other stuff, so that's why sometimes"
it's easier to go straight to an improper fraction for both of them.
"But in this case, it worked out doing it this way."

Hello. 
We are now gonna do some slope and y intercept problems as well. 
y-intercept problems as well. 
Let's get started. 
So let me make up a problem. 
"Let's say we have the points two, five. "
"The other point, let's make that negative three, negative three. "
"Well, first let's just graph those two points. "
I'm going to graph them in yellow. 
"So two, five. "
Let's see that's one two. 
"One, two, three, four, five. "
"So two, five is going to be right over there. "
OK. 
"And then let me graph negative three, negative three. "
"So it's one, two, three. "
"One, two, three. "
"So negative three, negative three is right over there. "
And then now let me draw a line that will connect them. 
That's my new technique. 
I draw it in two pieces. 
I think that's good enough. 
OK. 
So let's see if we can at least first figure out the slope of 
"the line, and then if we have time we'll try to figure "
out the y-intercept. 
And then we'll know the whole equation for the line. 
"Let me pick a slightly thinner color, and we'll get started. "
"So the slope, if you saw the last module that just "
"introduces how we calculate the slope, that's "
just rise over run. 
"Or, change in y over change in x. "
This is y. 
So let's just do that real fast. 
So let's take this as our starting point. 
"So change in y could be five-- remember, y is the "
second coordinate-- five minus negative three. 
And that's this one. 
"Over-- now you do the change in x-- two minus, this "
is also negative three. 
"Well five minus negative three, that's five plus plus three. "
So that equals eight. 
And then two minus negative three. 
"Once again that's two plus plus three, so that equals five. "
So we figured out the slope of this equation. 
It's eight / five. 
And let's see if that makes sense. 
Let's figure out what the rise and the run is. 
"If we were to start at this point right here, let's see how "
much we have to rise to get to the same y-coordinate 
as the other point. 
So let's see. 
"We're here, and the other point is up here. "
So let's figure out what this distance is. 
"Actually, now is a good time to use the fat. "
"Oh man, I have a shaky hand. "
OK. 
Let's figure out what that distance is. 
"That distance is delta y, which is change in y. "
"So it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. "
That equals eight. 
"And that makes sense, because if you think about it "
what did we just do? 
"We just took y equals five, which was up here, minus "
y equals negative three. 
And so obviously we just calculated that distance 
just by looking at the two coordinates five minus negative three. 
When you do this calculation it actually gives you 
this distance right here. 
So that's how we figure out how much we have to rise. 
So now let's do the run. 
"Well the run, to go from this point to the other "
"point, we went this far. "
And let's count how far that is. 
"Well, it's one, two, three, four, five units. "
So we can say delta x is equal to five. 
And that's exactly what we did. delta y over delta x was equal 
"to eight / five, or rise over run is equal to eight / five. "
And it would have been the same thing if we calculated run here 
or if we calculated rise here. 
But it's the same thing. 
Hope that's making sense to you. 
And I hope that also makes sense that if the rise for a 
"given run becomes more, then the slope of the line is going "
to become steeper and it'll become a bigger number. 
So let's see what we have so far for the 
equation of this line. 
"So so far we know the equation of this line is equal to, y is "
equal to the slope eight / five x plus b. 
So we're almost done. 
We just have to figure out this b right here. 
"Now that b, just so you remember, that's "
the y-intercept. 
And that's where we intersect the y-axis. 
"And since this graph is pretty neat, we can actually inspect "
"it and see that, well, it looks like we're intersecting "
the y-axis at two. 
So my guess is we're going to come up with b equals two. 
"But let's solve it, just in case we didn't have this "
neatly drawn graph here. 
So how can we solve for b? 
"Well, we can substitute values that we know "
that work for x and y. 
"Well either of these points are on that line, so we can "
substitute them in for x and y. 
So let's use the first one. 
OK. 
"So the y we get five, will equal eight / five times x. "
"Well, x there is two. "
Times two plus b. 
"Well, now we just get five is equal to sixteen / five plus b. "
"And then we get b equals-- well five is twenty-five / five, right? "
five is twenty-five / five minus sixteen / five equals nine / five. 
All right. 
"See, so I was actually wrong. "
"When I looked at this graph I said, oh that looks like "
"almost two, so yeah it's probably going to be two. "
"But when we actually did it using algebra, when we did it "
"analytically, we actually saw that b is equal to nine / five. "
So it's almost two. 
"9/5 is 1 and 4/5, or 1.8. "
"So that's almost two, but it actually turns "
out that it's not. 
It's at 1.8. 
And I can write it down as a decimal. 
1.8. 
"So the final equation for the line, I'm going to try to "
"squeeze it in at the bottom of this page, it's going to be y "
"is equal to-- well, we know the slope. "
eight / five x. 
Now we just add the y-intercept. 
Plus nine / five. 
There. 
We solved it. 
Let's do another one. 
And so-- that's nine / five. 
I don't want to be too repetitive. 
Let's do another problem. 
"Time to do another problem, and let me put that "
graph back there again. 
There you go. 
All right. 
I'm going to think of two random numbers again. 
"Let me try to do this fast, because YouTube puts a "
ten minute limit on me. 
"So let's say I had the points two, negative three. "
"And I had the point negative four, five. "
"So two, negative three. "
Let's plot that sucker real fast. 
"So x is two, so it's here. "
And the negative three. 
"One, two, three. "
"So two, negative three is there. "
"And negative four, five. "
"So that's one, two, three, four. "
"One, two, three, four, five. "
I have to count like this because this 
graph is unlabeled. 
But if we actually were to draw in the coordinates you would 
"that see this is five, and this is negative four, and so on. "
"And this is two, and this is negative three. "
And now let's just draw a line. 
Let's draw it right there with my shaky hand. 
OK. 
There you go. 
Good line. 
And another good line. 
All right. 
So first we need to figure out the slope. 
Well we could just do that doing the algebra. 
So its slope is just delta-- I'm still using the line tool 
again-- delta y over delta x. 
Change in y over change in x. 
Let's take this y as the first point now. 
"So we'll say five minus this y, negative three. "
Over-- now since we used the five first we have to use the 
negative four first as well. 
Negative four minus two. 
"Well five minus negative three, that equals eight. "
"And negative four minus two, well that equals negative six. "
"And negative eight / six, well that equals-- they're "
both divisible by two. 
So that equals minus four / three. 
"And let's see, does that make sense as the slope? "
"Well, if we were to go down four from this point. "
"So if the rise was negative four-- one, two, three, four. "
"So if we go down-- woops, I'm using white. "
So that's why you can't see it. 
"We go down by four here, and then we go to the right "
"three, positive three. "
We still end up on the line. 
So it works. 
Looks good to me. 
Let's see if I can solve the y-intercept in thirty seconds. 
"Otherwise, I'll start it on the next module. "
"So we get y is equal to minus four / three x, plus b. "
"And actually what we'll do is we'll leave off here, and I'm "
going to solve for b-- and you could try to do it on your 
own-- in the next installment of this presentation.

"We're told, solve the absolute value of 3x minus 9 is equal"
"to 0, and graph the solution on a number line."
So let's just rewrite the absolute value equation.
They told us that the absolute value of 3x minus
9 is equal to 0.
So we're told that the absolute value of the
something-- in this case the something is 3x minus 9-- is
equal to 0.
If I told you that the absolute value of something is
"equal to 0, I'm telling you that something has to be"
"exactly 0 away from 0, or 0 away from the origin on the"
So the only thing that that something could be is 0.
That's the only value whose absolute value is 0.
So if I told you that the absolute value of 3x minus 9
"is 0, than we know that 3x minus 9 has to be equal to 0,"
"and that's kind of unique about the 0 is that, it's the"
"only number the has a unique, that's only the"
absolute value of 0.
"If you had, say, a 1 here, you could say, oh well, then this"
thing could be a 1 or a negative 1.
"But here, if you have a 0, this thing can only be 0."
So solving this equation is fairly straightforward.
"If we want to isolate the 3x, get rid of the negative 9 on"
"the left-hand side, we add 9 to both sides of the equation."
"Add 9 to both sides of the equation,"
these 9's cancel out.
That's the whole point.
"On the left-hand side, you're just left with 3x, and on the"
"right-hand side, you are just left with 9."
"Now we want to solve for x, so we have 3 times x."
"Let's divide it by 3, because 3 times x divided by 3 is just"
"But if we divide the left side by 3, we have to divide the"
right side by 3.
So we are left with-- these guys cancel out.
"x is equal to 9 over 3, which is 3."
And that's our solution.
Now let's try out.
Let's make sure that this actually works.
Let's substitute it back into our original equation.
So we have the absolute value of 3 times x.
"Instead of x, I'll just put in our actual answer that we got,"
3 times 3 minus 9 has got to be equal to 0.
So what's this going to be equal to?
3 times 3 is 9.
"So it's the absolute value of 9 minus 9, which is the"
"absolute value of 0, which is, indeed, 0."

"Now here we'll just use the property if we have the product of things,"
let's say I have a times b and I'm raising that to some power n
"And to realize why that happens, let's just try it out with a simple example."
"If I have a times b to the third power, what is that going to be equal to?"
and then times a times b (and that's to the second power)
times a times b (that's to the third power).
We're literally taking this expression and multiplying it three times.
and associative properties of multiplication.
we can write this as a times a times a times b times b times b.
We have three a's here and three b's.
"So this right here is going to be equal to a to the third,"
and this right over here is going to be equal to be to the third.
"So we have a to the third and b to the third, and so it worked."
Hopefully this gives you a sense of why this property holds.
Now let's apply it to the actual problem!
So we have 4 a squared b to the third power.
That means that each of the components in the product are going to b raised
to the third power so that means that we have 4 to the third power times
a squared to the third power times b to the third power
"let me color code, this third power"
"here in mangenta, that's this third power over here"
"I'm just raising it, sort of taking the product first and then"
raising that to the third power
in the product and raised those to third power first
and then take the product. So that's what we are doing
Let's try to simplify this
"What is four, what is four to the third power"
"and we want to multiply 16 times 4,"
So 4 to the third power is just 4 times 4 times 4 is 64.
"or a to the sixth power, so this is a to the sixth power"
we got six from 2 times three and then finaly
we just have b to the third power and I'll juste write it over here
So we simplify this expression to 64 a to the sixth

So we're subtracting one rational expression from another.
"And just like the case when you are subtracting fractions,"
"So we need to find the least common multiple of 7m^2n and 3mn^4,"
and then that we can use as a common denominator.
Let's see if we can do that.
we have a negative sign out here and a common denominator over here.
So a common denominator is going to have ...
let's just look at each of the numbers.
We have a 7 here and a 3 over here.
So we're going to have to have 21 in our common denominator.
And I'm getting that by encorporating the 7 and the 3.
That's what gives me the 21.
then we're also going to be divisible by m
"So we're cool through the ""m""s."
"we're also divisible by n, since this is one of the factors of n^4"
If we're divisible by n^4 we are divisible by n
So that's our common denominator.

"so to get from 3m,"
"so let's see, to get from that to that"
you have to multiply it by a 7
you have to multiply it by 7
and to get from an m to an m^2 you have to multiply it by m
"And to get from n^4 to n^4, you didn't have to multiply by anything"
So to get from this expression in the denominator
you have to multiply it by 7m.
So if you multiply the denominator by 7m
you also have to ultiply the numerator by 7m
and now we are ready to subtract
since we have the same denominator
Let me write the denominator here
"we have the same power on m,"
So this is going to be -17
yup that works
and then all of that over 21m^2n^4.
Now let's see if we can simplify this further
"this becomes a 1, this becomes just an m"
both the numerator and denominator are divisible by n^3
"so you divide the numerator by n^3, that becomes 1"
"you divide the denominator by n^3, this becomes an n"
"-17 over, I'll do it in the same colors, 21mn."
And we are done.

"Imagine we listed all integers in a growing spiral, "
"and colored the prime numbers blue, "
and left the composite numbers black. 
"One interesting question we may ask is, "
"""How many primes are there "
"compared to composites?"" "
"First, let's zoom out to see the big picture. "
"Notice the prime color is dense in the center, "
and slowly drops off in the distance  
but never seems to end. 
One way I like to think about this is as follows: 
Imagine there is a tree at the center 
which is infinitely high. 
The leaves which drop from this tree 
represent prime numbers 
which are scattered unpredictably below  
dense near the base of the tree  
"and as we walk away from the tree, "
we find fewer leaves  
though we always find them. 
This is exactly what happens 
when we look at larger and larger integers. 
We always find more primes  
though the number of primes we find gradually drops 
the further [away from the tree] we look. 
So let's return to our question. 
How many primes are there less than some integer 'x?' 
"If we make a table, "
we see the number of primes is always increasing. 
"Though as we search further, "
we find fewer and fewer. 
Let's graph the number of primes 
"found on the vertical axis, "
"and the search size, x, on the horizontal. "
"As we zoom out to include billions of numbers, "
notice the curve never flat lines. 
"It's always rising, albeit gradually. "
"First, let's think about the density of primes "
less than some integer x. 
We can find the density by dividing 
the number of primes found by the search size. 
"For the first 100 integers, we find 25 primes  "
"therefore, 25% are prime. "
"Of the first 1000 integers, we find 1229 primes  "
12.29% are prime. 
"Of the first 1 million integers, 7.84% are prime. "
And the first 100 million integers contain 5.76% prime. 
"As we search further, this density continues to drop  "
though the speed at which it drops slows down. 
"Here is a graph of the search size on the horizontal axis, "
and the prime density on the vertical. 
"Notice that as we zoom out, "
the primes are a vanishing proportion of all integers. 
"Amazingly, we find this formula in nature. "
"We see it in galaxies, storms, flowers  "
and even inside our bodies  
as the design of least resistance  
known as the 'logarithmic spiral.' 
"Notice that as the spiral rotates, "
it gets further and further away from the center. 
"Incredibly, the rotation rate of a logarithmic spiral "
is related to the density of primes – as follows: 
We have the number of rotations  – call this 'phi'  
and the distance from the center  – call this 'r'. 
"If we graph phi against r, and zoom out, "
we see they are related 
according to the natural logarithm. 
This means the natural logarithm of the distance 
is related to the number of rotations. 
The graph of the natural logarithm is commonly written  
using the variable names 'y' and 'x'  
as y equals the natural logarithm of x [or y = ln(x)]. 
Notice the graph tapers off in the same way 
the density of primes gradually decreases. 
The final step is to invert this 
by changing the y axis to 1/ln(x). 
"And when we zoom out, "
we find the exact same curve generated 
when we plot the density of primes. 
Let's confirm this by overlapping the two plots. 
In green is a graph of the line y = 1/ln(x). 
And in red is the plot of prime number density  
up to x. 
"As we zoom out, they approach each other. "
"The further we zoom out, "
the more accurate the green estimate becomes. 
This is known as 
the 'asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers.' 
We now have a formula to accurately tell us 
the density of primes  – without counting. 
The density of primes up to some integer x 
is approximately 1/(ln(x). 
So let's say you need to know the density of primes 
between 1 and 100 trillion. Simple. 
"1/ln(100,000,000,000,000) = 3.1%. "
Compare this to the actual result 
from counting all primes – 
which is 3.2 percent. 
This is off by 0.1 percent. 
"And as we check larger and larger numbers, "
the difference approaches zero. 
Realize now that we can use 
this formula for prime density 
to estimate the number of primes up to x. 
The number of primes is the area under 
the density curve  
for which we can simplify 
by assuming density is constant. 
So the number of primes equals size times density – 
or x/ln(x). 
This is the prime number theorem. 
"Here is a graph of y = x/ln(x), in blue, "
and [the line] in yellow is a plot 
of an actual count of primes. 
"Notice as we zoom out, "
these lines eventually overlap as we look to infinity. 
And that is it. 
We have a formula which tells us approximately 
how many primes there are up to any value – 
 no counting needed. 
"For example, let's say we need to know "
the number of primes less than 100 trillion. 
100 trillion divided by 
the natural log of 100 trillion = 3.1 trillion. 
"Compare this to the actual count, "
which is 3.2 trillion. 
This is over 99.99 percent accurate – 
even at this relatively small scale. 
So to recap: 
"Given a search size up to some integer x, "
the prime density is about 1/(ln(x). 
And the number of primes is about x/ln(x). 
This is the prime number theorem.

Let's take a look at the answer about which intellectual property matched 
what is protectable in examples. 
"For trademark, what is protectable is branding. "
Examples are marks and logos and slogans. 
"For copyright, it's creative, authored works and expressions. Not ideas. "
"The examples could be software, songs, movies, website content. "
"For trade secrets, what's protectable is anything. Secrets that you think have economic value. "
"Examples are non-public technology like the Coke secret recipe, "
"or your proprietary customer list, or some kind of algorithm or formula "
you didn't want to patent. 
"For contract and non-disclosure agreements, what is protectable is whatever you "
and the person who is going to do the deal with you have defined in the contract 
and is enforceable in the law. 
"You could have technology, business information, etc. as examples. "
Finally patents. So what's protectable are non-obvious inventions.

Let me just remind you the reason why I love 
this lecture is that there is a series of common 
mistakes that first time an even experienced 
entrepreneurs make in thinking about revenue 
and pricing. And the first one is that this whole 
"idea about revenue stream, Steve, I get it. You "
"know, revenue stream. It’s about the price, the "
dollar amount I am charring customers. 
That’s a mistake. 
And you will see later that pricing is a tactic. 
"Or maybe I kind of get it, okay, now I understand "
"that pricing is a tactic, but I’ll set the price "
of a product based on how much it costs me 
"to make it. Well, how else would you set pricing. "
It cost me 99 cents to make it. I’ll charge 
"a $1.25 and, you know, that’s kind of a reasonable "
price. We’ll also see why that might be a huge 
mistake and leaving lots of money on the table. 
"And then kind of the third common errors, my "
price hast to be less than my competitor’s 
"price. If they’re charging $5,000, the best way "
to enter a market is to charge $4000. Why 
– no one would pay any more than the existing 
incumbents. And we’re going to see that’s 
another going out of business strategy. And 
all this depends on your knowledge that you’ve 
"just learned about the customers, their reaction "
to the value proposition and all the work you’ve 
been doing outside the building. You’re 
going to have an incredible advantage 
in thinking about revenue and pricing.

"Now, the story of a young man teaching math -- to the world. "
News Hour correspondent Spencer Michaels reports. 
"Sal Khan: So this is a quadratic equation, essentially. "
We're trying to find the zeroes of this... 
Reporter: This disembodied voice is heard every day 
by tens of thousands of students struggling with math -- 
both in the US and around the world. 
Sal: So what is x squared + 4x + 4? 
"Well, that's (x+2) times (x+2). "
Reporter: 33-year-old Salman Khan recently quit his job 
as a hedge-fund analyst to devote himself to an unpaid job 
teaching math on the Internet. 
Sal: Welcome to the presentation on basic addition. 
"I know what you're thinking. 'Sal, ...' "
These are cancers or cancer cells. 
As the investors in the mortgage-backed securities provide ... 
"Reporter: He has posted twelve hundred (1200) lessons on YouTube, which appear on an electronic blackboard, "
and range in subject from basic addition and advanced calculus to science and finance. 
And they are free. 
Sal: Introduction to trigonometry -- this is where I teach people about the trig functions. 
This is one of the more popular videos. 
"This has a 179,000 views. "
"This is just what ""sine,"" ""cosine,"" and ""tangent"" are. "
"Reporter: Khan lives in California's ""Silicon Valley"" with his wife, a rheumatologist in training at Stanford, and their new baby. "
He got the idea for Khan Academy four years ago when he taught a young cousin how to convert kilograms to grams. 
Many American students have trouble with math; 
and studies show they lag behind their counterparts in Asia 
and Europe in both math and science. 
"With Khan's help, his cousin got good at math, "
and he eventually had a new career tapping into anxieties around the world. 
"Now, he records his lessons from a converted closet in the back of his bedroom. "
He never goes on camera. 
Sal: It kind of feels like the voice in their head. 
You're looking at it. 
"It kind of feels likes someone's over your shoulder talking in your ear, "
as opposed to someone at a blackboard that's distant from you. 
Sal: [Coughs.] Sorry for starting the presentation with a cough. 
But now I want to continue with the 45-45-90 triangles. 
"Reporter: Although he is not the first person to teach on the Internet, "
"his simple operation has attracted more eyeballs than most university sites, and his fame has spread. "
The all-girl Castelleja School in Palo Alto invited Khan to speak; 
and he immediately connected to the student body. 
Sal: You tell me that you really don't know how -- you know -- 
dividing decimals is still kind of this little gray area. 
"And if dividing decimals actually is, you're not alone. "
Dividing decimals is kind of the one thing that no one wants to admit that they kind of forgot how to do. 
Reporter: He exuded pride in his expanding online audience. 
Sal: The more and more people kept watching it. 
"And now it's reaching actually on the order of about 100,000 students, now, a month, and 40,000 video views a day. "
"Reporter: It was the concept of short, repeatable lessons that attracted high-school senior, Bridget Meany, "
who admitted she'd had trouble with seventh-grade algebra. 
Bridget Meany: I think the teachers are good; but they can't go at a pace that's perfect for everyone. 
"But, I like the concept of knowing something in class, "
"but then going back and pressing pause or rewind, "
and actually getting a deeper understanding of it. 
"Shy students who don't ask questions in class may benefit the most from Khan's videos, "
"says Kimberly Knapp, who teaches math at Castelleja. "
But his lessons aren't a substitute for the classroom. 
"Kimberly Knapp: I don't think that there's a perfect replacement for the work that we do, "
and just the kind of conversations that students and teachers engage in together. 
Reporter: But Khan thinks maybe lecture halls and classrooms have their limitations. 
"Originally, he kept his lessons short because of YouTube restrictions. "
"Now, he thinks short is better. "
"Sal: I've gotten researchers telling me that ""You don't realize. "
"Ten minutes -- we've done studies - is how long someone can have a high level of concentration."" "
"And anything beyond that, you kind of lose it. "
And I think we've all had that experience in sitting in college 
"where, you can be with a professor for about ten or fifteen minutes, and then you kind of lose it. "
Reporter: A lot of math students apparently agree. 
"I talked via the Internet with Cody Woodward in Anchorage, Alaska, "
who uses Khan's lessons at college. 
"Cody Woodward: It has helped me immensely, "
and the grades for my math classes. 
And I've also learned a lot. 
"Reporter: Internet instruction, be it the Khan Academy, or taped university lectures, "
"could revolutiionize education in remote third-world locations, "
where access to high-quality instruction is frequently unavailable. 
"That's the hope of Neil Radia, a young software programmer at Cisco Systems. "
"He and fellow volunteers at World Possible, working on their vacations, "
are bringing online teaching to Africa and India for starters. 
"When [Neil] Radia and Megha Jain first traveled to Ethiopia, "
"they found thousands of brand new computers sitting idle, "
"because they couldn't connect to the Internet, and therefore, couldn't get online instruction. "
Neil Radia: A great thing to do would be putting a lot of these resources on a single local server 
"that we could bring to the colleges, to the universities, to community centers. "
"And we came across the Khan Academy, "
and we emailed him and asked him if we could reproduce some of his material on our servers; 
and he was very willing to help us out. 
Megha Jain: You'd be surprised how fast these kids learn and pick these things up. 
"So, it isn't strange to them. "
They've heard of this and they are excited to use it. 
"Reporter: For Khan, teaching math and science and finance is just the beginning. "
He's ready to expand his YouTube site to include whatever strikes his fancy. 
Sal: I want to do everything. I wanna do history; I wanna do grammar. I wanna do literally every subject. 
"Reporter: So far, except for a little advertising revenue, he is donating his time and equipment. "
It's a one-man operation. 
"But it's gotten so big, he expects to start soliciting outside support to keep his academy growing. "

"You say bacteria,those are germs."
"So we normally associate those with germs,and they indeed are germs,"
and they cause a whole set of negative things.
"Or at least from the standard point of view,"
"So let's just list them all just to make sure we know about them,"
"we're all on the same page.So the bad things they do,"
"they cause a lot of diseases:tuberculosis,Lyme disease."
"I mean,I could go on and on."
"You know,pretty much any time--well,I'll be careful here."
"An infection is,in general,anything entering you"
"and taking advantage of your body to kind of replicate itself,"
"and in the process,making you sick."
"But bacterial infections,let me write that down."
And this whole perception of bacteria being a bad thing
why almost any soap you see now will say antibacterial on it.
bacteria are viewed as a negative thing.
"For example,I could stick some yogurt in some--"
or I could stick some bacteria in some milk
And that's obviously a good thing.It's a delicious thing to eat.
"And these are all true,but you're like,look,you know,"
"on balance,I still think bacteria is a bad thing."
"I'm not going to take sides on that debate,"
as I tend to avoid taking sides on debates in these science videos.
Maybe I'll do a whole playlist where I do nothing
"but take sides on debates,but here I won't take any sides on that."
But I'll just point out that
you are to a large degree made up of bacteria.It's not just your gut.
It's not just the gut or the yogurt you might eat
"or the plaque on your teeth,which is caused by bacteria."
It's this kind of film that's created by bacteria
Bacteria actually represents a majority of the cells on your body.
And it's not just the pimples on your face.
So for every--and this is kind of an astounding fact.
"For every one cell on the human body,every one human cell--"
so these are all cells that all have your DNA in them
"and they'll have nucleuses,and I'll talk about that in a second--"
"you have 20 bacteria.Now,your response there is to say,"
"OK,that's fair enough,"
"but these bacteria must be much smaller than the human cell,"
so it must be a very small fraction of my mass.And you're right.
although we are mostly bacteria by actual cells.
"But even if you were to take out all of the water in your body,"
"then by mass,bacteria is going to be roughly 10% of your mass."
"So I weigh about 150 pounds,"
I've got 15 pounds of bacteria walking around with me.
So we always kind of think of ourselves
"as like the bacteria is riding on us,"
"but to a large degree,we're kind of in symbiosis."
"We're kind of two creatures,or not just two creatures,"
"two types of creatures living together,"
because I don't have just one type of bacteria on me.
I have thousands of types of bacteria on me.
"There's a huge amount of diversity,"
and we're just scratching the surface in terms of
the number and types and diversity of bacteria that exist.
"So I've talked a lot about bacteria,and hopefully,"
this fact right here will make you realize that
they're super important to just our everyday existence.
"Just to make sure we understand the magnitude of this,"
"in a previous video,and I looked this up again,"
"So for every one of these we have 20 bacteria,"
we're talking about having on the order of
"200 to 2,000 trillion bacteria on us at any time."
"And I'm a hygienic person.I take showers daily,and that's even me."
It's not like you can somehow eliminate them.
"But that's fair enough.You're probably asking,OK,Sal,"
I'm convinced that bacteria are important.
What do they actually look like?
And they're these small unicellular organisms.
And they're different from the cells that make up us.
"When I say us,I'll throw in all plants,animals and funguses,fungi."
"And the big difference,or the one that people noticed first,"
"is that all of the Eukarya,which includes plants,animals and fungi,"
"all of their DNA is inside of a nucleus,a cellular nucleus."
So that's the nucleus right there.
"And all of our DNA,it's normally in its chromatin form."
It's all just spread around something like that.
"In bacteria,which are what people originally just"
"classify it on whether or not you have a nucleus,"
"in bacteria,there is no membrane surrounding the DNA."
So what they have is just a big bundle of DNA.
They just have this big bundle of DNA.
It's sometimes in a loop all in one circle called a nucleoid.
"Now,whenever we look at something,and we say,oh,"
we have this thing;it doesn't;there's this assumption that
somehow we're superior or we're more advanced beings.
But the reality is that bacteria have infiltrated far more ecosystems
"in every part of the planet than Eukarya have,"
and there's far more diversity in bacteria than there is in Eukarya.
"So when you really think about it,"
these are the more successful organisms.
If a comet were to hit the Earth--God forbid--
the organisms more likely to survive are going to be the bacteria
"than the Eukarya,than the ones with the larger--not always larger,"
but the organisms that do have this nucleus
and have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and all that.
We'll talk more about it in the future.
They have their DNA there.
They do have ribosomes because they have to code for proteins
just like the rest of us do.
"Some of those proteins,they'll make some from--"
"bacteria,they'll make these flagella,"
which are tails that allow them to move around.
They also have these things called pili.
"Pili is plural for pilus or pee-lus,so these pili."
And we'll see in a second that the pili are kind of
how the bacteria are able to do one form of
"Actually,I'll take a little side note here."
I'm pointing out bacteria as not having a cell wall.
There's actually another class that used to be categorized
"as type of a bacteria,and they're called Archaea."
I should give them a little bit of justice.
They're always kind of the stepchild.
"They used to be called Archaea bacteria,"
"but now people realize,they've actually looked at the DNA,"
"because when they originally looked at these,they said,OK,"
these guys also have no nucleus and a bunch of DNA running around.
These must be a form of bacteria.
But now that we've actually been able to look into the DNA
And this just means no nucleus.
"but more generally,they don't have these membrane-bound organelles"
that our cells have.
"Now,the next question you might say is,well,"
"how do these bacteria reproduce?And for the most part,"
although I want to call it mitosis.
We call it binary fission.
"I'm not going to go into the deep mechanism here,"
"It replicates its DNA,so it'll have two of these nucleoids here,"
"and then the cytoplasm essentially splits,"
or it's kind of a form of cleavage right there.
It splits and then you have two of them.You have two of them then.
"to produce all of their extra appendages,the flagellum,"
"because it's operating at such a small scale,"
"Even at this very,very small scale,using very primitive--"
"I won't say primitive,because that's making a value judgment"
"on these things,but using--you know,"
"these flagellum are on the order of several nanometers,"
on the order of tens of nanometers wide.
"So you don't have a lot of atoms to deal with,"
but you're still able to get this kind of wave-like motion
that can move the bacteria around.
"Now,you're saying,hey,Sal,in that first video on evolution,"
you told me that we see evolution every day
and bacteria is one example.
"When we use antibiotics,we think it'll help eliminate bacteria,"
"but that one bacteria that has some type of resistance,"
How did these guys get variation?
"Well,the one way,and this is the way everything can get variation,"
is they can get mutations.
"And bacteria replicate so quickly,they reproduce so quickly that"
"even if you have a mutation that's one in every thousand times,"
"by the time you have a million bacteria,"
you'll have a thousand mutations.
"So they have mutations,but they also have this form."
"I don't want to call it sexual reproduction,"
because it's not sexual reproduction.
They don't form gametes and the gametes
don't fertilize each other and then produces a zygote.
But two bacteria can get near each other
and then one of their piluses--I'll do that right here.
"They're these little tubes,really."
"One of the piluses can connect from one bacteria to another,"
and then essentially you have a mixing of
what's inside one bacteria with another.
So let me draw their nucleoids.
And then they have these other pieces of just DNA
that hangs out called plasmids.
These are just circular pieces of DNA.
Maybe this guy has got this extra neat plasmid.
and it's making him able to do things that this guy couldn't do.
"Maybe this is the R plasmid,which is known for"
making a bacteria resistant to a lot of antibiotics.
"And what happens is,that bacteria--and actually,"
"there's mechanisms where the bacteria know that,hey,"
this guy doesn't have the R plasmid.
"And we're just beginning to understand how it actually works,"
but this will actually replicate itself
"You could also have these things,transposons,"
and I should make a whole video on this
"because we have transposons,too."
"one part of a fragment of DNA to another,"
"So what you have is kind of--it's not formal sexual reproduction,"
"but what you essentially have is a connection,"
and these bacteria are just constantly swapping DNA with each other
"and DNA is jumping back and forth,so you can imagine"
what you used to call one bacterial species
and very quickly can turn to multiple species
and become resistant to different things.
"If this makes it resistant to an antibiotic,"
then it can kind of spread the information to produce
those resistant proteins or whatever to the other bacteria.
So this is kind of a form of introducing variation.
"And so when you transfer stuff via this pilus,or the plural is pili,"
"Now,the last thing I want to talk about,"
"because it's something that you've heard a lot about,are antibiotics."
"A lot of people,they get sick."
The first thing they want to get is an antibiotic.
"And an antibiotic is just a whole class of chemicals and compounds,"
"So now if someone is undergoing a surgery and they get a cut,"
"instead of them having to worry about getting an infection,"
to prevent the bacteria from growing on them.
But the question is how was this discovered
or where does it come from?
"Very important,because the discovery of antibiotics is,"
"I forget which bacteria it was,but it was in a Petri dish."
There's a little circle.
There's some nutrients that the bacteria can grow on.
"So let's say the bacteria,you know,"
it's growing on this Petri dish.
"And he went out,and he came back into the room,"
"and he saw that some mold,some fungus had grown on this,"
kind of a bluish-greenish fungus
"And the bacteria,there was kind of this space around it,"
and the bacteria couldn't get close to it.
the Penicillium fungus.He was able to figure that out.
"He took a sample of this and then he cultured it,"
which means letting it grow and then seeing what it is.
"This was Penicillium.And he figured out that,gee,"
"this fungus must have something,some chemical that it's emitting"
that's not allowing the bacteria to get near it.
And so that led to the discovery of penicillin.
"This was in the late 20s,1920s."
"By the time World War II came around,"
"now people had gunshot wounds and they had to get things amputated,"
"whatnot,but for the first time,"
"And now,you know,if you have bacteria,"
"if you have tuberculosis or Lyme disease or anything,"
the treatment all involves taking antibiotics.
"And there are many,many more types of antibiotics"
"now coming from many, many more different sources,"

because some of it's good.
"In fact,we are made up a whole lot of bacteria."
There's bacteria in our skin that helps take up oil
and moisturizes and make our skin nice and supple.
"So,you know,the way you think about it,"
you could view them as negative or you could view them as positive
"or you could view them as something in between,"
"but the really amazing thing,at least in my mind,"
is that we're living in symbiosis with them.
"You had these people,and they were some alien race."
Jean Luc Picard had--they ran into them.
They looked very humanoid like that.
But it turns out--let me draw this human--
that they had these little bugs in their brain stem.
So they had these big insects in their brain stem
"and these insects started infecting the crew of the Enterprise,"
and they were controlling their brains and making them act weird
"and whatever not,and this seemed like a very bizarre alien concept"
of some creepy-crawlie living in us
and affecting our brains and affecting us in some ways.
"But if you really think about it,we are doing this,"
"and it's not just with one little bug,"
Hundreds of trillions of bugs are with us every day
"I mean,I'm here recording videos along with--"
or maybe I should even say the bacteria is recording videos
or it's maybe partially responsible for controlling bacteria.
There's a whole bunch of research now that
certain types of bacteria can cause schizophrenia.
"Actually,syphilis does.Bacteria can cause depression."
"Lyme disease,it's known that"
"when you go into later phases of Lyme disease,"
it can affect the mental condition of the person who has the infection
so it affects every part of who we are.

"without the 10% of our mass or the 2,000 trillion cells"

In this video I want to talk about what is easily one of the
most fundamental and profound concepts in statistics and
maybe in all of mathematics.
And what it tells us is we could start off with any
distribution that has a well-defined mean and variance.
"And if it has a well-defined variance, it has a well-defined"
standard deviation.
And it can be a continuous distribution or a discrete one.
I'll draw a discrete one just because it's easier to
imagine at least for the purposes of this video.
So let's say I have a discreet probability
distribution function.
And I want to be very careful not to make it look anything
close to a normal distribution because I want to show you the
power of the central limit theorem.
So let's say I have a distribution.
me make that a straight line-- you've a very high likelihood
"of getting a 1, let's say it's impossible to get a 2, let's"
say it's an OK likelihood of getting a 3 or a 4.
Let's say it's impossible get a 5.
And let's say it's very likely to get a 6 like that.
So that's my probability distribution function.
"If I were to draw a mean, this is symmetric, so maybe the mean"
would be something like that.
So that would be my mean right there.
The standard deviation maybe it would look-- it'd be
that far and that far above and below the mean.
But that's my discreet probability
distribution function.
"Now what I'm going to do here, instead of just taking samples"
of this random variable that's described by this probability
"distribution function, I'm going to take samples of it."
But I'm going to average the samples and then look at those
samples and see the frequency of the averages that I get.
And when I say average I mean the mean.
So let's say-- and let me define something-- let's say my
"sample size, and I could put any number here, but let's say"
So let's say the first time I take 4 samples.
So my sample sizes is 4.
So that right there is my first sample of sample size 4.
But when we talk about the sample mean and the sampling
distribution of the sample mean which we're going to talk more
"and more about over the next few videos, normally the sample"
refers to the set of samples from your distribution.
And the sample size tells you how many you actually took
from your distribution.
But the terminology can be very confusing because you can
We have a sample size of 4.
So let's say the mean-- I'm going to be very careful when I
1 plus 1 is 2.
2 plus 3 is 5.
5 plus 6 is 11.
11 divided by 4 is 2.75.
That is my first sample mean for my first sample of size 4.
Let me do another one.
My second sample of size 4.
"Let's say that I get a 3, a 4, let's say I get another 3,"
and let's say I get a 1.
I just didn't happen to get a 6 that time.
And notice I can't get a 2 or a 5.
That's impossible for this distribution.
The chance of getting a 2 or a 5 is zero.
So I can't have any 2's or 5's over here.
so my second sample mean is going to be 3 plus 4 is 7.
7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11.
11 divided by 4 once again is 2.75.
Let me do one more because I really want to make it clear
what we're doing here.
"more, but let me just do one more in detail."
going to literally takes 4 samples.
So my sample is made up of 4 samples from this original
crazy distribution.
2 plus 6 is 8.
8 plus 6 is 14.
And as I find each of these sample means-- so for each of
my samples of sample size 4 I figure out a mean-- and as I do
each of them I'm going to plot it on a frequency distribution.
And this is all going to amaze you in a few seconds.
So I plot this all on a frequency distribution.
"So I say, OK, on my first sample my first"
sample mean was 2.75.
So I'm plotting the actual frequency of the sample means
I get for each sample.
"So 2.75, I got it one time."
So I'll put a little plot there.
So that's from that one right there.
And the next time I also got a 2.75.
That's a 2.75 there.
So I'll plot the frequency right there.
Then I got a 3.5.
"So all the possible values, I could have a 3, I could have"
"a 3.25, I could have a 3.5."
So then I had the 3.5 so I'll plot it right there.
taking these samples.
"Maybe I'll take 10,000 of them."
So I'm going to keep taking these samples.
"So I go all the way to s 10,000."
I just do a bunch of these.
And what it's going to look like over time is each of these
I'm going to make a dot because I'm going to have to zoom out.
"So if I look at it like this, over time, it still has all"
the values that it might be able to take on.
"You know, 2.75 might be here."
So this first dot is going to be this one right here is going
to be right there and that second one is going to be right
there and then that one at 3.5 is going to look right there.
"But I'm going to do it 10,000 times so I'm"
"going to have 10,000."
I'm just going to keep plotting the frequencies.
over and over again.
"And what you're going to see is as I take many, many"
samples of size 4.
I'm going to have something that's going to start
kind of approximating a normal distribution.
So each of these dots represent an incidence of a sample mean.
So as I keep adding on this column right here that means
I kept getting the sample mean 2.75.
So over time I'm going to have something that's starting to
approximate a normal distribution.
And that is a neat thing about the central limit theorem.
"orange, that's the case for n is equal to 4."
original crazy distribution every sample I take 20
instances of my random variable and I average those 20 and then
I plot the sample mean on here.
"So in that case, I'm going to have a distribution"
that looks like this.
And we'll discuss this in more videos.
"But it turns out if I were to plot 10,000 of the sample means"
"here, I'm going to have something that-- two things:"
it's going to even more closely approximate a normal
distribution.
And we're going to see in future videos it's actually
"going to have a smaller-- well, let me be clear-- it's going"
to have the same mean.
It's going to have a smaller standard deviation.
So I should plot these from the bottom because
One you get 1 and then another instance then another instance.
But this is going to more and more approach a
normal distribution.
So the reality is-- and this is what's super cool about the
"central limit theorem-- as your sample size becomes larger,"
"or you can even say as it approaches infinity, but you"
really don't have to get that close to infinity to really get
close to a normal distribution.
"Even if you have a sample size of 10 or 20, you're already"
getting very close to a normal distribution.
"In fact, about as good an approximation as we see"
But what's cool is we can start with some crazy
"distribution, right?"
This has nothing to do with a normal distribution.
But if we have a sample size-- this was n equals 4-- but if we
"have a sample size of n equals 10 or n equals 100, and we were"
to take 100 of these instead of 4 here and average them and
"then plot that average, the frequency of it."
"Then we take 100 again, average them, take the"
"mean, plot that again."
"And if we were to do that a bunch of times, in fact, if we"
"were to do that an infinite time, we would find--"
especially if we had an infinite sample size-- we
would find a perfect normal distribution.
That's the crazy thing.
And it doesn't apply just to taking the sample mean.
Here we took the sample mean every time but you could have
The central limit theorem would have still applied.
But that's what's so super useful about it.
"Because in life there's all sorts of processes out there,"
"proteins bumping into each other, people doing crazy"
"things, humans interacting in weird ways."
And you don't know the probability distribution
functions for any of those things.
But what the central limit theorem them tells us is if we
"add a bunch of those actions together, assuming that they"
"all have the same distribution, or if we were to take the mean"
of all of those actions together and if we were to plot
"the frequency of those means, we do get a normal"
distribution.
And that's frankly why the normal distribution shows up so
much in statistics and why frankly it's a very good
approximation for the sum or the means of a lot
of processes.
Normal distribution.
What I'm going to show you in the next video is I'm actually
going to show you that this is a reality.
"That as you increase your sample size, as you increase"
"your n, and as you take a lot of sample means, you're going"
"to have a frequency plot that looks very, very close to"

what I'm gonna do in this video is talk about what
2 parties can transact
over the internet
I'll call these parties Alice &amp; Bob
"&amp; let's say Alice, for whatever reason,"
"this maybe because she owes Bob money,"
or maybe Bob is a merchant &amp; Alice is buying something from Bob
so there can be many reasons why Alice is trying to pay Bob
now if Bob is willing to accept
"Bitcoins, which are a form of electronic payment"
then Alice can go ahead &amp; send Bob
"some value in Bitcoins, &amp; really,"
a Bitcoin transaction between Alice &amp; Bob
"and, this will be done entirely over the internet"
these numbers will have certain mathematical properties
"that make it hard for some to really defraud the system, or to"
conduct some type of nefarious action on the system
"&amp; the way that Alice is actually going to conduct this transaction in practice is,"
"either by, installing a special piece of software, which we call a Bitcoin client,"
but either case (either the client / the service) is gonna generate these numbers for Alice
"that will take these numbers &amp; allow him to do something else with those numbers, for example"
"Bob can, in turn, buy something on his own with those numbers, or he can trade those numbers in for"
alright
now 1 of the 1st questions you might have
&amp; I kind of alluded this earlier
"is: ""Why would Bob even want to accept Bitcoin in the 1st place?"""
"after all, a Bitcoin is just a bunch of numbers."
"Bitcoins actually have real world value, there are"
more &amp; more merchants popping up each day who accept Bitcoin for transactions
"&amp; there are also, Bitcoin exchanges, places where you can go &amp; exchange"
Bitcoin for more mainstream currencies
some of these exchanges include
"the major one is called ""Mt. Gox"""
"&amp; in Mt. Gox, you can exchange your Bitcoin for Euro, Yen, Dollar, &amp; so on &amp; so forth"
"now the current price, the current value of Bitcoin in US Dollar as of this video is"
approximately $100 per Bitcoin
"&amp; there's gonna be some fluctuations, but as people understand the currency better"
&amp; the value of what you can procure with that Bitcoin. It's just like
"you would for a Dollar, Euro, or Yen. The faith that you have"
in that currency's value is how you value that currency
"now another you might have is: ""Why do people even bother with Bitcoin in the 1st place?"""
"I mean, aren't there other more standards ways?"
Why couldn't Alice &amp; Bob use Paypal?
Why couldn't they use a credit card number to transact?
Why couldn't Alice just send Bob an electronic check?
"Why not use one of these other approaches that are more well understood, more mainstream,"
that are more established. Why would you possibly want to mess with a good thing?
"So it turns out there are a few properties of Bitcoin that are worth noting, for starters,"
there's privacy
"from the perspective of Bitcoin, Alice's identity is gonna be a sequence of numbers"
"&amp; that sequence of numbers, is effectively gonna function"
&amp; that sequence of numbers has nothing to do with her real world identity
nobody knows this is Alice transacting
all they need to worry about is the pseudonym within the system
"&amp; this is kind of, but not quite, like what you'd get if you bought something using cash"
"when you buy something using cash,"
then you don't have to provide any details / proof regarding who you're in the real world
"&amp; that's different from let's say,"
"you have to provide your name, billing address, &amp; so on"
where you need to tie that electronic check typically to your bank account details
"okay, now I do wanna also mention here that"
cash ??? or transaction that uses cash
malicious purposes to buy illicit goods & services
that definitely is a risk that occurs when you provide anonimity &amp; privacy
but there are certainly legitimate reasons why somebody might
wanna conduct a transaction privately &amp; not have the whole world
know what they're transacting
another property of Bitcoin is that it's open
anyone who has Internet connection can make a Bitcoin transaction
"&amp; all you need to do to get started, is download this special Bitcoin client"
"&amp; the Bitcoin client, or for that matter, you can use"
"anyone who has a Bitcoin client or who owns an account with an exchange like Mt. Gox,"
can engage in Bitcoin transactions
"that transaction, the details of it, the mechanics of it, will be transparent to the user"
all the user has to worry about
the actual software underneath will take all the underlying mechanics of making that transaction work
"now this is different when you think about traditional currency, like a Dollar"
"we often take it for granted, but there are people out there who may not have access to credit card, bank account, for example"
"in United States alone, it turns out (I just looked this up)"
the number of households without a bank account
"is somewhere north of 8%. It's pretty high, a lot of people out there who wouldn't be able to conduct"
"by they way, there are people using Bitcoin all over the world, literally"
it doesn't matter where you are
"in the world, as long as you have internet connection, you can start transacting Bitcoins"
Now another property of Bitcoin worth mentioning is that it's decentralized
there's no bank / centralized entity that can really control
"what's happening in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it's all done in this kind of ad-hoc fashion"
"&amp; what that means is that,"
"when you do a transaction, when Alice transacts with Bob over the internet,"
that transaction is ??? with third party. There's no
there's no bank that gets in the way of that transaction
no one entity can directly control the money supply of Bitcoin &amp; so on
that also means that no one entity can
"let's say, seize your assets, for that matter"
no one entity can reverse a transaction
which is definitely desirable for some merchants
"Some merchants might not be able to conduct business online, because of fraud concerns"
"&amp; if you have a system where the transactions can't be charged back easily,"
"then, from the merchant's perspective,"
now I wanna point out this last property of decentralization
definitely causes concerns among some people about Bitcoin.
"After all, when you think about it, a central authority like a bank"
"does a perform an important function in the context of traditional currency, for example,"
"now in Bitcoin, this validation is basically done in a decentralized way"
"by the other party, the other nodes in the Bitcoin network"
"another goal of the remaining videos in this series, is to walk through the underlying mechanics"
"really how they're validated, even though the system is decentralized"
and there are some pretty amazing techniques that are used
"Bitcoin is a very complex protocol, it has many moving parts"
"&amp; I think it's pretty cool, when you can understand something this complex"
"&amp; hopefully the other videos in this series,"
"will help you to understand, these different parts"

If you E-stop your side-mount tool changer during a tool change 
It is easy to recover and return to making parts 
The tool changer on this VF-2SS needs to be recovered 
The machine is running software version 18.05 
which includes the latest tool changer recovery procedure 
Reset the emergency-stop condition 
On the screen is the notification “ARM NOT AT ORIGIN” 
"On the keypad, press RECOVER and “A” "
for automatic recovery following the on-screen prompts 
"During automatic recovery, the spindle drawbar unclamps "
and you will hear a blast of air coming from the spindle nose 
The tool change arm will rotate in reverse 
and put the tools back into the carousel and spindle 
Then the arm will return to its original position 
The tool changer is now reset 
Regardless of where the arm stops 
it will always recover in the reverse direction 
and because the recovery process puts the tools back where they came from 
the sequence on the “Tool Table” remains unchanged 
and does not need to be updated after recovery is complete 
The recovery process for machines with older software is more involved 
"Using the older software, this is what we do if the arm is not contacting the tool "
Place boxes filled with packing foam under the spindle and tool carousel pocket 
This will catch any tool that accidently drops during the recovery process 
Push the RECOVER button 
If there are tools in the spindle or arm 
and if the arm position will prevent these tools from being easily removed 
respond yes both times to the on-screen prompts 
This brings up the screen for adjusting 
"the arm rotation, pocket position, and drawbar unclamping "
Remove any tool that's in the spindle using “TOOL RELEASE” 
If there are tools in the tool change arm they must be removed 
Rotate the arm using ATC reverse until the tools can be easily reached 
and removed by pushing down on the release plungers 
Any tool held in a tool pocket that is in the down position can stay in the pocket 
Simply move the pocket UP by pressing the arrow up key 
With a few additional key strokes this recovery is complete 
It is also possible that the arm is stuck 
while gripping a tool that is still clamped in the spindle 
"In this case, the spindle drawbar will need to be set "
to the unclamped position during the tool removal 
This is done so that the arm doesn’t try to pull 
the tool out of the spindle while the drawbar is still clamping it 
"To start, press tool release to unclamp the drawbar "
Note that the drawbar will stay unclamped until tool release is pressed again 
"Next, press ATC reverse repeatedly "
until the tool change arm has moved away from the spindle 
Release the first tool from the arm 
then rotate the arm until the second tool can easily be removed 
"Continue rotating until the arm reaches the origin position, as shown on the screen "
Then reset the tool pocket with the arrow up key 
"Finally press Y a few more times, to complete the process "
The carousel rotates to the “current pocket” and any tools that were removed 
during the recovery process can now be re-loaded into the tool changer 
Be sure to update the tool pocket table with the locations of the reloaded tools 
thus bringing the recovery process to completion

What I want to talk about in this video is 
one of the darker periods in Chilean history and 
"depending on your point of view, "
also one of the darker periods in American history. 
And what I want to make clear 
in this video and it really applies to every video I make on history is 
be skeptical of everything that I'm telling you. 
I'm going to do my best attempt to give you a 
reasonably accurate series of events and draw connections when they're clear 
And also make it clear where there might be connections and 
no one is sure. But you should be skeptical 
"and frankly, you should be skeptical of anything anyone is telling you "
I encourage you all to use this as a scaffold for 
"your own research, for you to look up these names "
and these events and figure out what actually happened. 
"Now wth that said, let us rewind back to 1970, "
when Chile was having an election for president and 
they have their election and it's considered a 
fairly free and fair election. One of the candidates of 
"that election was this gentleman over here, "
"Salvador Allende, who was a known Marxist. "
He has communist ideologies here and he is known to be 
"sympathetic to what has happened in Cuba, "
sympathetic to the Soviets. 
"So you can imagine in this context, America is concerned. "
It's in the middle of the Cold War. 
"You have Richard Nixon, president. "
"You have Henry Kissinger, as his secretary of state. "
They are actively watching this election. 
They clearly do not want Salvador Allende to become president. 
"All of a sudden a major country in Latin America, "
controlled by a Marxist. 
"Unlucky for them, Salvador Allende actually does get more votes than everyone else. "
"He gets 36 percent of the votes, which is a plurality. "
"Just so you know what plurality means, "
"it means you got more votes than anyone else, "
but not necessarily the majority of the votes. 
If he had gotten 51% of the votes that would be a majority. 
In this case he didn't get a majority and the standard procedure in Chile is that 
if no one gets a majority it goes to Congress and Congress picks who's president. 
And the usual thing that they would do is that they would pick whoever has the largest amount of votes. 
They normally didn't do a runoff. 
"So you can imagine Nixon and Kissinger, they're worried "
"so they kind of get into ""let's mess with what's going on in Chile"" mode "
"and this part is well-established, that they had this, what they called a Track 1 strategy, "
of actually trying to get the Chilean Congress to not do what they normally do 
to not pick the guy with the largest number of votes. 
So they were trying to mess there. Didn't seem like something they would be able to pull off. 
"The other thing that it looks like they started to kind of get involved with, through the CIA, is "
they started to at least interface--it's not clear how much they actually supported--they actually started to talk to people in the military 
"and see, well, how likely is a coup to happen? "
How likely is Allende to be overthrown if he becomes president? 
"They were looking for people who could, I guess, keep this known Marxist from becoming president. "
And the number one problem was this guy right over here. 
The number one problem was this guy right over here. 
"In this whole video, I would say that Rene Schneider was the only unambiguously good guy in this video. "
He was the commander in chief of the Chilean military 
"and he said, ""Look, I don't care who becomes president, I don't care how much I disagree with him, "
I don't care how much pressure the Americans put on me 
or how much pressure the rest of the military puts on me 
"the role of the Chilean military is not to mess with politics."" "
They call him the constitutionalist. 
The role of the Chilean military is not to overthrow people when we don't like them. 
The role of the Chilean military is only to defend Chile. 
"Is only to literally do, I guess, what militarys are supposed to do, what constitutions say the military is supposed to do. "
"So you can imagine that the people who wanted to overthrow Allende, "
"now that he's, now that it looks like he's going to come to power, "
they say that this guy is not a convenient guy to have in power. 
He doesn't like to play the way we play. 
Even though there were other elements in the military that did want to do that. 
"And so, and this is what is a little unclear, you have this former general in the Chilean military "
"who is clearly anti-Allende, and he is also anti-Schneider. "
"Because this guy right here, Roberto Viaux, he thinks that the military should be, I guess, "
actively overthrowing dictators. 
So there is some contact between him and the CIA. 
"It seems like the CIA may have supplied some support to him and then gotten a little freaked out, "
"at least Kissinger might have gotten a little freaked out, that this guy seemed a little bit extreme. "
"But remember, we are in this period where Allende was, he got 36% of the votes, "
Congress is kind of trying to figure out what they do about it. 
"And during this period there are some people say, "
"""Well, look, if Rene Schneider is not going to do what's in their mind the 'right' thing "
"and depose the eventual Allende, then we'll have to depose Rene Schneider."" "
So you have this plot that's worked up by Roberto Viaux 
to essentially kidnap Rene Schneider that would essentially depose him 
from being head of the military and they could put in his place 
"someone who is more likely to have a coup, more likely "
to want to overthrow Allende. 
"Unfortunately, when this guy's people try to kidnap Schneider, "
"Schneider he's got a gun, he sees these guys kidnapping "
"he takes out the gun and then the kidnappers shoot him, several times and he eventually dies. "
"So this essentially turns into, this kidnapping turns into an assassination of Rene Schneider "
and they wanted to kill him just because or remove him 
or whatever just because he essentially wanted to do his job. 
So he's the only person in this whole narrative where I'll say he was an unambiguous good guy. 
Now what's not clear is how much involvement the Americans or the CIA had 
in supporting this kind of assassination or this kidnapping of Schneider. 
It does look like they kind of knew something was going on. 
"This is a quote from Kissinger. Seems pretty well substantiated, where he told Nixon, "
"a few days before Scheider was assassinated, "
"when Nixon said, ""Hey, what's going on in Chile? "
"Are we working on any ways through the military, are we doing anything potentially, maybe about Schneider?"" "
I don't know. Look that up for yourself. I don't know how much Nixon may or may not have known. 
"Kissinger told Nixon, ""This looks hopeless. I turned it off. Nothing could be worse than an abortive coup."" "
So this quote is interesting because it looks like they thought about it. 
"I mean, ""I turned it off"" which implies that at one point he had it turned on. "
"So at one point they were actively thinking about working with Roberto Viaux, "
"maybe to kidnap Schneider, maybe to orchestrate a coup against Allende "
"but they turned it off. So it's definitely not, they're not morally above doing this type of thing, "
but they decided this guy was not as competent as maybe they thought he should 
"and at least according to Kissinger, he's saying, "
"""We turned it off because nothing could be worse than an abortive coup."" "
"And it turned out that's exactly what happened, because as soon as this guy go killed, "
"everyone was like, oh my god, you have all of these shady elements "
who are trying to kind of overthrow democracy. 
"And that actually put more pressure on Congress to say hey, we have to let Allende become president. "
So in November he gets inaugurated president. 
"November, Allende becomes president. "
"And this is always, there is a bunch of different stories here "
how much the CIA was involved. 
"The counter-argument is look, the CIA would not have wanted to assassinate Schneider "
"because this would have only made it, made Allende all the more popular. "
They would only have wanted to remove him and put someone else there 
who was more likely to have a coup against Allende later. 
"Who knows? If you believe Kissinger's words, it looks like maybe he, "
they provided some initial support to Viaux and then they backed off a little bit. 
"Who knows? Well regardless, by November of 1970 Salvador Allende became president. "
And he starting implementing his kind of Marxist ideology and it didn't go that well. 
"Chile's economy, especially if you fast forward to 1972, 1973, not doing so well. "
He started doing price fixing. He tried to do the fairly naive approach 
"of raising salaries while keeping prices fixed, which will obviously lead to shortages. "
"So all around, he wasn't the most popular president. "
"It didn't look like his, especially his economic policies, were working out that well. "
"People who are pro-Allende would say, well look, just like what the United States did to Cuba "
they started doing in Chile. 
"As soon as they had a Marxist in charge, someone they didn't like, "
the United States started swinging its huge economic power around to kind of hurt the Chillean economy 
so that this guy would come out of power. 
I let you decide that. 
You fast forward all the way to 1973. So now Allende has been in power for about three years. 
Things are not going well for him. There are strikes going on. 
He tries to clamp down on the media a bit. 
There is unrest. There people who definitely do not want him to be president anymore. 
And the people who don't think much of the United States will say 
"Hey, but the United States the whole time was kind of actively undermining Allende and that's probably true. "
"The United States will say no, look, we were trying to keep the press free. "
This guy was clamping down on free press. 
We were trying to keep things so that there will be another election. 
So that this guy won't turn into another Fidel Castro 
"and essentially just turn Chile into a totalitarian, Communist regime. "
"Regardless of which side you take, on September 11, 1973 Allende is deposed. "
"The military surrounds the presidential palace and, "
"it is said, that he commits ""suicide."" "
"And I put that in quotes because, once again, some people believe that he really did commit suicide. "
Some people believe he was assassinated. 
And some accounts say that he committed suicide with an automatic weapon. 
"Well, I guess you could commit suicide with an automatic weapon, "
but it doesn't seem like the weapon of choice for many people. 
But I'll leave that once again for you to decide. 
"Maybe it's not even, well, whether or not he committed suicide, "
"or whether he was killed, "
"but regardless, on September 11th he gets thrown out of power "
"and once again, it's not clear what role the CIA played. "
They clearly were sympathetic to the people who wanted to overthrow him. 
They clearly were providing indirect support throughout Allende's regime 
to all of the people who were anti-Allende. 
"And you could look up, there are actually some declassified documents "
that hint at what the level of CIA involvement might have been. 
"Regardless to say, Allende deposed, and this gentleman comes to power right over here. "
"Augusto Pinochet. And he comes to power and he says, "
"look, you know, this democracy thing is silly. "
I am the president. I am the commander in chief. 
Chile will be run by military junta. And let me write that word down. 
Chile will be run by a junta. 
And a junta just means a government that's run by the military. 
It's a military dictatorship. The military is now in charge of Chile. 
We don't need people to do silly things like voting anymore. 
"And you can imagine Nixon didn't care so much that this guy didn't like democracy, "
"but he was happy, let me see if I can put a smile on his face, "
"he was happy that at least Pinochet was not a Marxist, "
that at least we had stopped the spread of Communism in Latin America. 
"Unfortunately, and Nixon with that said, and this is explicit, he wanted to do everything in his power "
"to make Augusto Pinochet successful, especially from an economic point of view. "
"So Nixon does, we do, the United States does start supporting Pinochet. "
He's viewed as kind of an American friend. 
"Unfortunately for America and unfortunately for Chile, this guy is one of those big time tyrants in history. "
So he is a tyrant. And he starts rounding up people. 
"He starts killing people. He's one of those people that anything, anyone who had a whiff of Communism, "
"or a whiff of political opposition, he would round them up "
"he would round their family up, he would torture people. "
And just to kind of put some...and this is another picture of him when he's older. 
It's amazing how gentle some fairly evil people can look in the world. 
So I'll put some unambiguous horns on him. 
"But he killed many, many people. "
"And many, many people disappeared. "
And just to give an idea of what this...these are some of the people who disappeared. 
"And it was anyone from people who were critical of him, people who were perceived to be left-leaning, whatever it was. "
"And he tortured, including women and children and all the rest. "
"So all around bad guy. He stuck around in Chile as president until 1990, so that's 17 years. "
And he really stayed in power until 1998 where he was commander in chief of the army. 
"You can imagine if the military is in control, the president isn't that important of a title, "
commander in chief is. 
"So for 25 years he hung around Chile and he continued to be kind of this totalitarian guy, "
"although he was a big, he liked free markets, he was a capitalist in the traditional sense. "
"And the one, I guess, silver lining, if you have to throw a silver lining on Pinochet's regime "
is that the Chilean economy actually did well during his regime. 
Chile is considered one of the success stories economically over that time period. 
So I'll let you decide. 
"And some people would say, oh, that's because Pinochet was, he understood economics. "
He didn't try to do all this price fixing stuff that Allende tried to do. 
"Regardless of the fact that he was a tyrant, "
"at least people, you know, the economy was doing well. "
"The other side of the equation would be, well look, of course the economy did well. "
"Now you had the United States doing everything in its power, "
"this huge, the largest economy in the world doing everything in its power "
to make sure that Chile's economy thrives while one of its buddies are in power. 
"So I'll let you decide who's right, who's wrong, "
what was the actual involvement of the CIA and Nixon and Kissinger 
and all of this mess over here. 
"But I think, needless to say, that this was a not so pleasant chapter in, I guess, world history. "

The next piece is who are your key partners and suppliers. 
Partnerships are kind of interesting is we need to ask ourselves before what's the deal 
"is what exactly are we acquiring from partners, and also "
what activities are they going to perform and when. 
And this is where a start up sometimes make a mistake of thinking while large companies 
"do partnerships, I guess I need those two on day 1. "
Change all the types of partnerships you need in year 1 are certainly not the ones 
"you're going to need in year 3 or 5 or 10, and the types of partnerships could be strategic alliances, "
"joint ventures, just regular suppliers and buyers, and you need to be thinking through "
""
The interesting thing about the customer development process 
ties back into agile engineering and agile development hand and glove. 
Basically it's this notion of the minimum viable product. 
Back in the old days what we used to do is specify 
the entire feature set of the product 
from beginning to end. 
"Now, this makes sense when you're in a large company "
"releasing version 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 "
"because you kind of have a feeling of who the customers are and what they need, "
so a product manager can be pretty accurate about 
"I've been interacting with customers for the last year and a half, "
and I think I know what they need. 
"But in a startup you're really kind of guessing, "
"and the odds are you're going to be guessing wrong, "
so rather than waste a whole ton of time and money 
why don't we actually get outside the building before we build something 
"and waste a lot of engineering time, and more importantly, "
"cash, because that's what puts startups out of business is running out of money. "
We want to make sure that we actually listen to the people 
who eventually will buy this product. 
We want to make sure we satisfy their wants and needs. 
Why don't we just figure out how to build the minimum viable product? 
Build the minimum features in order to get feedback. 
"Now, feedback could take the form of input verbally, "
"or they gave you early orders, or they gave you anything that was valuable "
in helping you come to closure on what should we be building in what order? 
"And by the way, an MVP could be something as simple on the Web "
"as a wireframe or a PowerPoint slide, "
"or for physical products it could be a physical mockup, "
or it could be a working part of the system. 
But as you get more feedback you could start adding more features. 
One caveat is a comment I always get is 
"""Steve Jobs didn't build the iPhone by asking customers."" "
And we really doubt Henry Ford asked customers 
do they want a car before one existed. 
"In fact, in his case if you would have asked people about what they wanted "
they would have said a faster horse or one with 6 legs. 
"And so the immediate response is ""Well, therefore for new products "
"you just don't get out of the building at all,"" and that's just a fallacy. "
"There is a type of startup in what we call a new market, "
and we'll be describing new markets in the Customer Segments lecture. 
But just understand that in new markets of course you don't get out 
and ask people what features they need. 
But you do want to understand how is their day in a life 
different today versus the day after you give them your new product? 
How does their world change? 
And there's no possible way sitting locked in your conference room 
or your office you would know that without talking to customers.

Rewrite the expression below 
applying the commutative 
"and associative properties of addition, "
and then show that both expressions yield 
the same result. 
"So, one, we could just "
evaluate the expression the way 
"that it is written, then "
we could mess around with it using the 
commutative and associative properties of addition. 
So lets first add 17.5 plus 3 
so that's going to give us 
"20.5, so this is "
going to be 20.5. 
And to then to that we're going to add negative 7.5. 
Now adding -7.5 is the exact same thing 
as subtracting 7.5. 
so this is going to be equal to - 
the .5s cancel out - 
and then 20 minus 7 is 13. 
So that's our first way of getting the answer 
and we kind of adhere to the parentheses. 
Now let's use the commuatative property. 
The commutative property tells us that the order doesn't matter; 
"we can commute these numbers around, "
they can move (commute). 
It's like you're going to work. 
They can move around. So lets just move the numbers around. 
"Let's make it, let's make it, actually "
we could do all sorts of crazy things. 
"We could make it, one we could "
just change the order here. 
We could make this -7.5 plus 17.5 plus 3. 
"We could keep the parentheses, just like that, "
"so we would have essentially just changed the order of this expression, "
but let's use the commutative and the associaive property. 
"So now we've commuted everything around, "
and now we can reassociate everything. 
"So instead of putting the parentheses like that, "
we could put the parentheses like that. 
So that's what the associate property tells us. 
Let me write this down. 
So associative property of addition 
tells us that (a+b)+c where you do a+b first 
is the same as a+(b+c) where you do b+c first. 
The commutative property 
tells us that a + b = b + a 
that you can move these guys around. 
So let's evaluate this one. 
"We actually got here using both the commutative and the associative property, "
so we get -7.5 + 17.5. 
This is the exact same thing as 
17.5 -7.5. 
"It might be easier for you to realize, "
"""Okay, I'm adding two numbers of different signs, so "
"what I could do is take the difference between the two, "
"and since the larger number is positive, "
I have a larger number. 
"Or you could just do this as 17.5 - 7.5."" "
"So 17.5 - 7.5, "
the .5s cancel out. 17 - 7 is 10. 
So this part right here 
becomes 10. And we still have the plus three there 
and that once again that is going to be 
equal to 13. And we could keep commuting this around and 
keep reassociating it 
"and no matter how we do it, we are going to get 13. "
""
Let's learn a little bit about the law of large numbers 
"which is on many levels, one of the most intuitive laws "
in mathematics and in probability theory. 
"But because it's so applicable to so many things, it's often "
"a misused law or sometimes, slightly misunderstood. "
"So just to be a little bit formal in our mathematics, "
let me just define it for you first and 
then we'll talk a little bit about the intuition. 
"So let's say I have a random variable, X. "
And we know its expected value or its population mean. 
The law of large numbers just says that 
"if we take a sample of n observations of our random variable, "
and if we were to average all of those observations-- 
and let me define another variable. 
Let's call that x sub n with a line on top of it. 
This is the mean of n observations of 
our random variable. 
So it's literally this is my first observation. 
So you can kind of say I run the experiment once and 
"I get this observation and I run it again, I get that observation. "
And I keep running it n times and 
then I divide by my number of observations. 
So this is my sample mean. 
This is the mean of all the observations I've made. 
The law of large numbers just tells us that my sample mean 
will approach my expected value of the random variable. 
Or I could also write it as my sample mean will approach 
my population mean for n approaching infinity. 
And I'll be a little informal with what does approach or 
what does convergence mean? 
But I think you have the general intuitive sense that 
if I take a large enough sample here that I'm going to end up 
getting the expected value of the population as a whole. 
And I think to a lot of us that's kind of intuitive. 
"That if I do enough trials that over large samples, the trials "
would kind of give me the numbers that I would expect 
given the expected value and the probability and all that. 
But I think it's often a little bit misunderstood 
in terms of why that happens. 
And before I go into that let me give you 
a particular example. 
The law of large numbers will just tell us that-- let's say 
I have a random variable-- X is equal to the number of heads 
after 100 tosses of a fair coin-- tosses or flips 
of a fair coin. 
"First of all, we know what the expected value of "
this random variable is. 
"It's the number of tosses, the number of trials times "
the probabilities of success of any trial. 
So that's equal to 50. 
So the law of large numbers just says if I were to take a sample 
"or if I were to average the sample of a bunch of these trials, "
"so you know, I get-- my first time I run this trial "
I flip 100 coins or have 100 coins in a shoe box and 
"I shake the shoe box and I count the number of heads, and I get 55. "
So that Would be X1. 
Then I shake the box again and I get 65. 
Then I shake the box again and I get 45. 
And I do this n times and then I divide it by 
the number of times I did it. 
The law of large numbers just tells us that this the average 
"the average of all of my observations, "
is going to converge to 50 as n approaches infinity. 
Or for n approaching 50. 
"I'm sorry, n approaching infinity. "
And I want to talk a little bit about why this happens 
or intuitively why this is. 
"A lot of people kind of feel that oh, this means that "
if after 100 trials that if I'm above the average that somehow 
the laws of probability are going to give me more heads 
or fewer heads to kind of make up the difference. 
That's not quite what's going to happen. 
That's often called the gambler's fallacy. 
Let me differentiate. 
And I'll use this example. 
So let's say-- let me make a graph. 
And I'll switch colors. 
"This is n, my x-axis is n. "
This is the number of trials I take. 
"And my y-axis, let me make that the sample mean. "
"And we know what the expected value is, we know "
the expected value of this random variable is 50. 
Let me draw that here. 
This is 50. 
So just going to the example I did. 
So when n is equal to-- let me just [INAUDIBLE] 
here. 
So my first trial I got 55 and so that was my average. 
I only had one data point. 
"Then after two trials, let's see, then I have 65. "
And so my average is going to be 65 plus 55 divided by 2. 
which is 60. 
So then my average went up a little bit. 
"Then I had a 45, which will bring my average "
down a little bit. 
I won't plot a 45 here. 
Now I have to average all of these out. 
What's 45 plus 65? 
Let me actually just get the number just 
so you get the point. 
So it's 55 plus 65. 
It's 120 plus 45 is 165. 
Divided by 3. 
3 goes into 165 5-- 5 times 3 is 15. 
It's 53. 
"No, no, no. "
55. 
So the average goes down back down to 55. 
And we could keep doing these trials. 
"So you might say that the law of large numbers tells this, "
"OK, after we've done 3 trials and our average is there. "
So a lot of people think that somehow the gods of probability 
are going to make it more likely that we get fewer 
heads in the future. 
That somehow the next couple of trials are going to have to 
be down here in order to bring our average down. 
And that's not necessarily the case. 
Going forward the probabilities are always the same. 
The probabilities are always 50% that 
I'm going to get heads. 
It's not like if I had a bunch of heads to start off with or 
"more than I would have expected to start off with, that "
all of a sudden things would be made up and I would get more tails. 
That would the gambler's fallacy. 
That if you have a long streak of heads or you have 
"a disproportionate number of heads, that at some point "
you're going to have-- you have a higher likelihood of having 
a disproportionate number of tails. 
And that's not quite true. 
What the law of large numbers tells us is that it doesn't care 
Let's say after some finite number of trials 
"Your average actually-- it's a low probability of this happening, "
but let's say your average is actually up here. 
Is actually at 70. 
"You're like, wow, we really diverged a good bit from "
the expected value. 
"But what the law of large numbers says, well, "
I don't care how many trials this is. 
We have an infinite number of trials left. 
"And the expected value for that infinite number of trials, "
especially in this type of situation is going to be this. 
So when you average a finite number that averages out to 
"some high number, and then an infinite number that's going to "
"converge to this, you're going to over time, converge back "
to the expected value. 
"And that was a very informal way of describing it, "
but that's what the law or large numbers tells you. 
And it's an important thing. 
It's not telling you that if you get a bunch of heads that 
somehow the probability of getting tails is going 
to increase to kind of make up for the heads. 
"What it's telling you is, is that no matter what happened "
"over a finite number of trials, no matter what the average is "
"over a finite number of trials, you have "
an infinite number of trials left. 
And if you do enough of them it's going to converge back 
to your expected value. 
And this is an important thing to think about. 
But this isn't used in practice every day with the lottery and with casinos 
because they know that if you do large enough samples 
and we could even calculate 
"if you do large enough samples, "
what's the probability that things deviate significantly? 
But casinos and the lottery every day operate on this principle 
"that if you take enough people-- sure, "
"in the short-term or with a few samples, "
a couple people might beat the house. 
But over the long-term the house is always going to win 
because of the parameters of the games that 
they're making you play. 
"Anyway, this is an important thing in probability and "
I think it's fairly intuitive. 
"Although, sometimes when you see it formally explained "
like this with the random variables and that 
it's a little bit confusing. 
"All it's saying is that as you take more and more samples, "
the average of that sample is going to 
approximate the true average. 
Or I should be a little bit more particular. 
The mean of your sample is going to converge to 
the true mean of the population or 
to the expected value of the random variable. 
"Anyway, see you in the next video. "
""
Let's do a few more examples of finding 
the limit of functions as x approaches 
infinity or negative infinity. 
"So here I have this crazy function, "
[reads function] 
So what's going to happen as x 
approaches infinity? 
"And the key here, like we've seen "
"in other examples, is just to realize "
which terms will dominate. 
"So for example, in the numerator, "
"out of these three terms, "
the 9x^7 is going to grow much faster 
"than any of these other terms, "
so this is the dominating term 
"in the numerator, and in the denominator, "
"3x^7 is going to grow much faster than an x^5 term, "
and definitely much faster 
than a log base 2 term. 
"So at infinity, as we get closer and closer to infinity, "
this function is going to be roughly equal to 
"9x^7 over 3x^7, and so we can say, "
"especially since as we get larger and larger, "
"as we get closer and closer to infinity, "
these two things are going to get 
"closer and closer to each other, "
we can say this limit is going to be 
"the same thing as this limit, "
which is going to be equal to 
the limit as x approaches infinity - 
"well, we can just cancel out the x^7's, "
"so it's going to be 9/3, or just 3, "
which is just going to be 3. 
So that is our limit as x approaches infinity 
of all of this craziness. 
Now let's do the same with this function 
"over here. Once again crazy function, "
"we're going to negative infinity, "
but the same principles apply. 
Which terms dominate as the absolute value 
"of x gets larger and larger and larger, "
as x gets larger in magnitude. 
"Well in the numerator, it's the 3x^3 term, "
"in the denominator it's the 6x^4 term, "
so this is going to be the same thing as 
the limit of 3x^3 over 6x^4 
as x approaches negative infinity. 
"And if we simplify this, this is going to be equal to "
the limit as x approaches negative infinity 
of 1 over 2x. 
And what's this going to be? 
"Well if the denominator, even though it's "
"becoming a larger and larger negative number, "
it becomes one over 
"a very, very large negative number, "
which is going to get us pretty darn close 
"to zero, just as one over x as "
x approaches negative infinity gets us close to zero. 
"So this right over here, "
the horizontal asymptote in this case 
"is y is equal to 0, "
"and I encourage you to graph it, "
or try it out with numbers to verify that for yourself. 
The key realization here is to 
simplify the problem by just thinking 
about which terms are going to 
dominate the rest. 
Now let's think about this one. 
What is the limit of this crazy function 
as x approaches infinity? 
"Well once again, what are the dominating terms? "
"In the numerator it's 4x^4, "
"in the denominator it's 250x^3, "
these are the highest degree terms. 
So this is going to be the same thing 
as the limit as x approaches infinity 
"of 4x^4 over 250x^3, "
which is going to be the same thing as 
the limit of - let's see - 
4 - well I could just - this is 
going to be the same thing as - 
well we could just divide 250 - well 
I'll just leave it like this. 
It's going to be the limit of 4 over 250 
- x^4 divided by x^3 is just x - 
"times x, as x approaches infinity. "
"Or, we could even say this is going to be 4/250 "
times the limit as x approaches infinity of x. 
Now what's this? 
What's the limit of x as x approaches infinity? 
"Well it's just going to keep growing forever, "
so this is just going to be - 
this right over here is just going to be 
"infinity, and infinity times some number "
"right over here is going to be infinity, "
so the limit as x approaches infinity 
of all of this is actually unbounded. 
It's infinity. 
And a kind of obvious way 
of seeing that right from the get-go 
is to realize that the numerator 
"has a fourth degree term, "
while the highest degree term in the denominator 
is only a third degree term. 
So the numerator is going to grow 
far faster than the denominator. 
So if the numerator is growing far faster 
"than the denomiator, "
you're going to approach infinity in this case. 
If the numerator is growing far slower 
"than the denominator, "
if the denominator is growing far faster 
"than the numerator, like this case, "
you are then approaching zero. 
So hopefully you find that a little bit useful. 
""
Factor 8k squared minus 24k minus 144. 
"Now the first thing we can do here, just eyeballing each of these terms "
if we want to simplify it a good bit is 
all of these terms are divisible by 8. 
"Clearly 8k squared is divisible by 8, 24 is divisible by 8, "
"and 144, it might not be as obvious is divisble by 8, "
but it looks like it is. 8 goes into 
"144- 8 goes into 14 one time, 1 times 8 is 8 "
"subtract, you get a 6 (14 minus 8 is 6), "
bring down the four- 8 goes into 64 8 times. 
So it goes into 144 18 times. So let's just 
"factor out an 8 of this, and then that'll simplify "
"our expression, it'll actually give us a leading one coefficient. "
So this will become 8 times k squared minus 
24 divided by 8 is three k minus 18. 
"Now we have to factor this business in here, "
and remember if anything has the form 
"x squared plus bx plus c, where you have a "
leading one coefficient (this is implicitly a 
"one, we have that here in this expression in "
"parentheses), then we literally just need a "
(and we can do this multiple ways) but we need 
to find two numbers whose sum is equal to the 
"coefficient on x, so two numbers whose sum is equal "
"to negative three, and whose product is equal "
"to the constant term, and whose product is "
equal to negative 18. So let's just think 
"about the factors of -18 here, let's see if we "
can do something interesting. So it could be 
"one, and since it's negative one of the numbers "
has to be positive and one has to be negative. 
"1 and 18 is if it was positive, and one of these "
"could be positive and one could be negative, "
"but no matter what, we're either going to have "
"pos- we're either- if you, if this is negative "
"and this is positive, they add up to 17; but "
"if you switch them then they add up to negative 17, "
so those won't work. So either (you can write 
it this way) positive or negative 1 and then 
negative or positive 18 to show that they 
have to be different signs. So those don't work. 
Then you have positive or negative 3 and then 
"negative or positive 6, just to know that they are "
different signs. So if you have positive 3 and 
"negative 6, they add up to negative 3, which "
"is what we need them to add up to. And clearly, "
they- positive 3 and negative 6 their product 
is negative 18. So it works! So we're going to go with 
positive 3 and negative 6 as our two numbers. 
"Now, for this example, just for the sake of this "
"example, we'll do this by grouping. So what we "
can do is we can separate this middle term right here 
"as the sum of 3k and -6k, so I can write the "
negative 3k as plus 3k minus 6k (let me write the 
"rest of it)- so we have k squared up here, plus 3k "
"minus 6k, which is the same as this thing over here, "
and we have minus 18. And then all of that's being 
multiplied by 8. Now we're ready to group this thing- 
"we can group these first two terms, they are both "
"divisible by k, and then we can group these second "
two terms. So then we have 8 times (let me write 
"brackets here, since we're using double parentheses "
- brackets are really just parentheses that look a 
"little bit more serious)- OK, now let's factor "
out a k from this term right here (using a different 
color)- let's factor out the k here. So this is k 
"times k plus 3, and then we have a plus, and over "
here it looks like we could factor out a negative 6. 
So let's factor out (let me use a different color) 
-let's factor out a negative 6 over here. So 
plus negative 6 times (k plus 3). So now it looks 
like we can factor out a k plus 3; there's a k plus 3 
"times a k, and then we have a k plus 3 times the "
negative 6. So let's factor that out- so we have this 8 
"out front, that's not changing (let me write that and "
"the brackets)- we're factoring out a k plus 3, so then "
"we have a k plus 3 that we factored out, and then inside "
of that we just have left this k (instead of writing 
"plus negative 6, I could just write k minus 6). "
We factor out the k+3 and we're done! And then we 
"can rewrite this- this, the way we wrote it here "
"is 8 times the product of k plus 3 times k minus 6, "
but we know from the properties of multiplication that 
this is the exact same thing as 8 times k plus 3 
times k minus 6. And we are done.

Rewrite the expression five times 9 minus 4-- that's in
parentheses-- using the distributive law of
multiplication over subtraction.
Then simplify.
So let me just rewrite it.
"This is going to be 5 times 9 minus 4, just like that."
"Now, if we want to use the distributive property, well,"
you don't have to.
You could just evaluate 9 minus 4 and then
multiply that times 5.
"But if you want to use the distributive property, you"
distribute the 5.
"You multiply the 5 times the 9 and the 4, so you end up with"
5 times 9 minus 5 times 4.
"sense, why you don't just multiply it by the 9."
And we're going to verify that it gives us the same answer as
"if we just evaluated the 9 minus 4 first. But anyway,"
"So 5 times 9, that is 45."
So we have 45 minus-- what's 5 times 4?
"Well, that's 20."
"45 minus 20, and that is equal to 25, so this is using the"
distributive property right here.
"If we didn't want to use the distributive property, if we"
"just wanted to evaluate what's in the parentheses first, we"
would have gotten-- let's go in this direction-- 5 times--
9 minus 4 is 5.
Let me do that in a different color.
5 times 9 minus 4.
So it's 5 times 5.
"5 times 5 is just 25, so we get the same"
answer either way.
This is using the distributive law of multiplication over
"subtraction, usually just referred to as the"
distributive property.
This is evaluating the inside of the parentheses first and

i got a comment on the video where we first introduced parallax - especially relative to stars - essentially 
"asking how do we know that this angle and this angle are all the same, or how do we know that we are "
always looking at an isosceles triangle where this side is equal to this side? it worked out for this 
"example that i drew right here, but what if the star was over here, what if the star was over here? "
"then if you just look at it this way, if you take it at this point, the triangle is no longer (clearly) "
"an isosceles triangle. it looks more like a scalene triangle, i guess, where all the sides are different. "
"and so a lot of that trigonometry would not apply, because we would not be able to assume that this is "
a right triangle over here. and what i want to make clear is that that is true. you would not be able 
"to pick these two points during the year, these two points in our orbit, 6 months apart, in order to "
do the same math that we did in the last video. in order to calculate this and still have an isosceles 
"triangle, what you want to do is pick two different points, 6 months apart. so what you want to do is "
"this is the sun, you want to pick two different points 6 months apart, where it DOES form an isosceles "
"triangle. so if this is the distance from the sun to this other star right over here, you want to pick "
"a point in the earth's orbit around the sun here and then another point in the orbit 6 months later, "
"which would put us right over here. and if you do that, then we are, now all of a sudden, looking at "
"two right triangles, if we pick those periods correctly. and the best way to think about "
"whether this is a perpendicular angle is we are going to try to find the maximum parallax from the center, "
in each of these time periods. 
"here it's going to be maximally shifted in one direction, and then when you go this 6 months later, "
it's going to be maximally shifted in the other direction. 
"so the answer to that question, the observation is right, at exactly the middle of the summer, or the "
"middle of the winter, all the stars will not form an isosceles triangle with the sun and the earth. but you can "
"pick other points in time around the year, 6 months apart, where any star will form an isosceles triangle. "
hopefully you found that helpful.

I've been sent another maximization or minimization
"problem, and this seemed to be an interesting twist on what"
"we've already done, so let's do this one."
Let's see.
The length of its base is twice its width.
"So let's see, let me do it a different color."
""
"OK, so I'll do it over here."
""
"So this is the base, and if I call this the width, so"
"this is x, the length is twice that, this is 2x."
"The length of its base is twice the width, right?"
"So this is the length of the base, this is the width."
OK?
"Material and then the height, for now, is unknown."
"OK, so let's do a couple things."
"First, let's figure out what the height is in terms of x,"
and then we can find an equation for the cost in terms
"of x, and then take the derivatives, and find the"
So what do we know about this?
What's the volume of this box?
"say, this is the length, but it doesn't really matter."
Length times the width times the height.
"So it's 2x times x, 2x squared times h."
"So it's 2x squared times h, right?"
"Base times height times width, whatever."
Length times width times height.
Just the volume of a rectangle.
"And they already said that the volume is 10 meters cubed,"
