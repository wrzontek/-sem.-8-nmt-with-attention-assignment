them comes from this cell. 
And two of them comes from this cell. 
"So that makes sense, relative to the "
intuition I just gave you. 
So let's just fill out this box. 
Let's just fill out the box. 
This is going to be one plus two is three as well. 
Let's fill out-- let me switch colors just to make it 
interesting. 
This is one plus three is four. 
Three plus three is six. 
Three plus one is four. 
And you can kind of see a symmetry along this diagonal. 
Right? 
There's a three and a three. 
A four and a four. 
"And if you've seen the videos on the binomia coefficients, "
"or Pascal's triangle, you should hopefully start seeing "
"a pattern, or some recognizable numbers here. "
So what's this? 
This is five. 
And this square has all sorts of neat things here. 
You have all ones. 
"And you have one, two, three, four, five, six. "
"Well, six right? "
One plus five. 
"Let's see, four, five, six. "
Six plus four is 10. 
Six plus four is 10. 
10 plus five is 15. 
15 plus six is 21. 
10 plus 10 is 20. 
10 plus five is 15. 
21. 
"See, this is 35. "
35. 
70. 
35 plus 21 is 56. 
35 plus 21 is 56. 
56 plus 70 is 126. 
And then 126 plus 126 is 252. 
So let me do that in a special color. 
"There's 200, right? "
"yeah, 252 ways from getting from there to there. "
"And that was just a neat kind of pattern problem, to "
understand this. 
And you could just fill it out. 
And you can actually do this for any n by m. 
It doesn't even have to be n by m. 
"You could figure out, I could have said the problem, how "
many ways are there to get to this square? 
And you would have solved it. 
"Once you see that pattern, you can just do simple addition "
and figure it out. 
"To do it by hand, to figure out the 252 ways of getting "
there would have taken you forever. 
It would have wasted all of your time. 
But there's something interesting here. 
"If you did watch the video on binomial coefficients, you'll "
recognize that these are the binomial coefficients. 
Actually let me draw something for you and maybe you'll 
recognize it there. 
And this is all bonus relative to the problem. 
You have now solved it. 
"If your whole goal was just to solve this problem, and not to "
"see how it connects to other mathematics, then you can stop "
watching it now. 
But now I'll show you something neat about it. 
"So, if you wanted to figure out x plus y to the nth power. "
And we do this a lot in the videos on Pascal's triangle 
and binomial coefficients. 
But I want to show you it's the same exact thing here. 
"This might actually be even an easier way for you to do it, "
than using Pascal's triangle. 
Although it's essentially the same thing. 
"If you write one, x, x, x squared, x to the third, x to "
"the fourth, x to the fifth. "
These are supposed to go on top of the square. 
But I realize I was running out of space. 
"You write one and y, y squared, y to the third, y to "
"the fourth, y to the fifth. "
"And if I were to say, given this, what is x plus y, I "
"don't know, to the fourth power? "
"So what you can do is, you say OK, well, x plus y to the "
"fourth is going to be, you know, x to the fourth plus "
"something, something, something, a bunch of terms, "
"all the way to y to the fourth, and "
everything in between. 
"So as you go here, where you say, x to the fourth all the "
way down to y to the fourth. 
So it'll be this diagonal right here. 
So let me draw this diagonal. 
So this diagonal right here. 
And these will essentially tell you to the coefficients. 
And not only will it tell you the coefficients. 
It will tell you the mix of the coefficients. 
So what do I mean by that? 
So let me erase some stuff here. 
This is all bonus to the actual problem. 
We've solved the problem. 
So I can erase all of this. 
So we want to figure out x plus y to the fourth. 
All we have to do-- and I'll leave you the play with this 
cube a little bit more just to see all the patterns in it and 
what do the numbers do along each row and each column and 
each diagonal? 
"But if you want to figure out x plus y to the fourth, or "
actually just this is x to the fourth. 
Or you could say one x to the fourth. 
"One x to the fourth times one, which is just one x to the "
"fourth, plus four x to the third, times y. "
Right? 
That's just this one right there. 
"Then you say, plus six x squared y squared. "
""
And they we're at plus four x y to the third. 
And then finally plus one y to the fourth times 
just a one or an x. 
"And you might say, that's amazing Sal. "
How did that work? 
"And the way to think about it is, when you multiply this x "
plus y to the fourth-- and I encourage you to try it if 
you're bored one day --there's actually six ways to get an x 
squared y squared term. 
You'll see that when you multiply it all out. 
And we did that in kind of the intuition behind the binomial 
theorem videos. 
"But there's six ways to get there, which is the exact same "
problem as the brain teaser that I gave you before. 
How many ways can you get to this square? 
"Well, we figured out there are six ways. "
Anyway hope that you enjoyed that a little bit.

Let's say I have a balloon 
and in that balloon i have a bunch of particles bouncing around 
they're gas particles 
so they're floating freely 
"and they all have, they each have some velocity "
some kinetic energy 
and what I care about 
what I care... let me just draw a few more 
what I care about is the pressure that is exerted 
on the surface of the balloon 
so I care about the pressure 
and what's pressure? it's force per area 
force per area 
"so the area here, you can think of it as "
the inside surface of the balloon 
"and what's going to put force, "
what's going to apply force to that? 
"at any given moment i only drew what, 6 particles here "
but in a real balloon you would have 
"you know, gazillions of particles, you know "
"we could talk about how large, but more particles "
"than you could really, probably imagine "
but at any given moment some of those particles 
are bouncing off the wall of the container 
"that particle is bouncing there, this particle "
"is bouncing there, this guy's bouncing like that "
"and when they bounce, they apply a force to the "
"container, an outward force, that's what keeps "
the balloon blown up. 
So let's think about what the pressure 
is going to be dependent on. 
"So first of all the pressure, the faster these "
"particles move, the higher the pressure, right? "
Faster particles 
faster particles would imply pressure would go up 
right? slower particles you're gonna be bouncing 
into the container less 
and when you do bounce into the container 
"there is going to be less of a ricochet, "
or less of a change in momentum 
so slower particles 
you're gonna have pressure go down 
now it's practically impossible to measure 
"the kinetic energy, or the velocity "
or the direction of each individual particle 
as especially you have gazillions of them 
in the balloon 
so what we do is we think of 
the average energy of the particles 
and the average energy of the particles 
"you might say oh, Sal's about to introduce us "
to a new concept 
"well I might, well it's a new of looking at a "
probably very familiar concept to you 
and that's temperature 
temperature can and should be viewed 
as the average energy of the particles in the system 
so i'll put a little squiggly line 
"cause it's, you know, there's a lot of ways to "
think about.. Average energy 
"or, you know... some, and mostly kinetic energy "
right? because these particles are moving and bouncing 
"the higher the temperature, the more "
the faster that these particles move 
and the more that they're going to 
bounce into the side of the [sic]particle 
into the side of this container 
but temperature is average energy 
"it tells us energy, energy per particle "
"right, if you wanted to know the total, so you know "
obviously if we only had one particle in there 
with super high temperature 
that's going to have less pressure 
then if we have a million particles in there 
let me draw that 
if i have.. if i have.. 
let's take two cases right here 
one is: i have a bunch of particles with 
a certain temperature 
moving in their different directions 
and in the other example i have one particle 
right? 
and maybe they have the same temperature 
on average they have the same kinetic energy 
the kinetic energy per particle is the same 
cleary this one is going to be applying 
more pressure to its container 
cause at every given moment 
more of these particles are gonna be bouncing 
off the side 
"then in this example, this guy is gonna "
bounce —bam— and gonna go and move and bounce bam 
so he's gonna be applying less pressure 
even though his temperature might be the same 
"because temperature is kinetic energy, or you "
can view it as kinetic energy per particle 
or it's a way of looking at kinetic energy per particle 
so if we wanted to look at the total energy 
"in the system, we would want to "
multiply the temperature 
times the number of particles 
and just since we are dealing on the molecular scale 
the number of particles can often be represented 
"as moles, remeber, moles is just the number of particles "
so we're saying that pressure 
"pressure, is well I'll say, it's proportional "
"so it's equal to let's say, some constant "
let's call that R times 
(cause we've got to make all the 
units work out in the end 
I mean temperature's in Kelvin 
but we eventually want to get back to Joules 
so let's just say it's equal to some constant 
or it's proportional to temperature 
times the number of particles 
we could do that a bunch of ways 
but let's think of that in moles 
but if I say they're 5 mole particles there 
you know that's 5 times 6 times 10 to the 23 particles 
so this is a number of particles (n) 
this is the temperature (T) 
and this is just some constant (n) 
"constant, right there. "
now what else is the pressure dependent on? 
we gave these two examples 
obviously it's dependent on the Temperature 
"the faster each of these particles move, "
the higher pressure it will have 
it's also dependent on the number of particles 
the more particles we have 
the more pressure we'll have 
what about the size of the container? 
the volume of the container? 
"if we took this example, but we shrunk the container somehow maybe by pressing on the outside "
"so this container looked like this, but we still had the same four particles in it "
the same four particles with the same average 
"kinetic energy, with the same temperature "
"so that number of particles is the same, "
the temperature's the same 
but the volume has gone down 
now these guys are gonna bump into 
the sides of the container more frequently 
"and there's less area, right? "
"so at any given moment, you have more force "
and less area 
so when you have more force and less area 
the pressure's gonna go up 
so when the volume went down 
your pressure went up 
"so pressure is going to be, is going to be "
"we could say, we could say "
pressure is inversely proportional to volume 
so let's think about that 
let's put that into our equation 
we said that pressure 
"sorry, not ressure "
"pressure is proportional, and I'm just saying "
"some proportionality constant, let's call that R "
to the number of particles times the temperature 
(this gives us the total energy) 
and it's inversely proportional to the volume 
and so if we multiply both sides of this 
times the Volume 
"we get the pressure, times the volume is proportional "
to the number of particles times the temperature 
and then you know 
so PV is equal to R n t 
and just to switch this around a little bit 
so it's in a form that you are more likely to see 
"in your chemistry book, if we just switch "
the n and the R term 
you get P (pressure) times volume is equal to 
n (the number of particles you have) 
times some constant times temperature 
and this right here is the ideal gas equation 
ideal gas equation 
and hopefully makes some sense to you 
ideal gas (not not gass) equation 
they say ideal gas is based on 
this little mental exercise I did to come up with this 
i made some implicit assumptions when I did this 
"one is I assumed, I essentially I assumed that "
that we are dealing with an ideal gas 
"and so you say, what Sal, what is an ideal gas? "
"an ideal gas, is one where the molecules "
they're not too concerned with each other 
they're just concerned with their own kinetic energy 
and bouncing off of the walls 
so they don't attract or repel each other 
don't attract or repel.... 
cause let's say they are attracted to each other 
"then as you increased the number of particles, "
maybe they'd want to not go to the side 
maybe they'd all gravitate towards the center a little bit more 
if they did attract each other 
"and if they did that, they would bounce into the walls less and the pressure would be a little bit lower "
so assuming that they don't attract or repel each other 
and we're also assuming that the actual volume 
of the individual particles are inconsequential 
which is a pretty good assumption 
because they're pretty small 
altough if you start putting a ton of particles 
"into a certain volume then at some point, "
especially if they are big molecules 
it will start to matter in terms of their size 
but we're assuming that for the purposes of 
our mental exercise that the molecules have 
inconsequential volumes 
and they don't attract or repel each other 
and in that situation we can apply the ideal gas 
"equation, right here. "
Now we've established the ideal gas equation 
"but we're like oh,oh what's R, how do I deal with it, and how do I do math problems "
and solve chemistry problems with it 
and how do the units all work out 
"we'll do all of that in the next video, where i will solve a ton of equations, or a ton of exercises "
with the ideal gas equation 
"but the important thing, the important take away from this video "
"is just to have the intuition, as to why this actually does make sense "
"and frankly once you have this intuition, you should never forget it "
you should be able to maybe even derive it on your own. 
""
"I want to show you a way that, at least, I find more useful to "
subtract numbers in my head. 
And I do it this way-- it's not necessarily faster on 
"paper, but it allows you to remember what you're doing. "
Because if you start borrowing and stuff it becomes very hard 
to remember what's actually going on. 
So let's try out a couple of problems. 
Let's have nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine. 
So the way I do this in my head. 
I say that nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine-- you have to 
remember the two numbers. 
"So the first thing I do is I say, well, what's nine thousand four hundred fifty-six "
minus just seven thousand? 
That's pretty easy because I just take nine thousand minus seven thousand. 
So what I can do is I'll cross out this and I'll 
subtract seven thousand from it. 
And I'm going to get two thousand four hundred fifty six. 
So in my head I tell myself that nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine is the 
same thing as-- if I just subtract out the seven thousand-- 
as two thousand four hundred fifty-six minus five hundred eighty-nine. 
I took the seven thousand out of the picture. 
I essentially subtracted it from both of these numbers. 
"Now, if I want to do two thousand four hundred fifty-six minus five hundred eighty-nine what I do is I "
subtract five hundred from both of these numbers. 
"So if I subtract five hundred from this bottom number, "
this five will go away. 
"And if I subtract five hundred from this top number, what happens? "
What's two thousand four hundred fifty-six minus five hundred? 
Or an easier way to think about it? 
What's twenty-four minus five? 
"Well, that's nineteen. "
So it's going to be one thousand nine hundred fifty-six. 
Let me scroll up a little bit. 
So it's one thousand nine hundred fifty six. 
So my original problem has now been reduced to one thousand nine hundred fifty-six minus eighty-nine. 
Now I can subtract eighty from both that number and that number. 
So if I subtract eighty from this bottom number the eight disappears. 
Eighty-nine minus eighty is just nine. 
"And I subtract eighty from this top number, I can just think of, "
"well, what's one hundred ninety-five minus eight? "
"Well, one hundred ninety-five minus eight, let's see. "
Fifteen minus eight is seventeen. 
So one hundred ninety-five minus eight is going to be one hundred eighty-seven and then you 
still have the six there. 
"So essentially I said, one thousand nine hundred fifty-six minus eighty is one thousand eight hundred seventy-six. "
And now my problem has been reduced to one thousand eight hundred seventy-six minus nine. 
And then we can do that in our head. 
What's seventy-six minus nine? 
That's what? 
Sixty-seven. 
So our final answer is one thousand eight hundred sixty-seven. 
And as you can see this isn't necessarily faster than the way 
we've done it in other videos. 
"But the reason why I like it is that at any stage, I just "
have to remember two numbers. 
I have to remember my new top number and my 
new bottom number. 
My new bottom number is always just some of the leftover 
digits of the original bottom number. 
So that's how I like to do things in my head. 
"Now, just to make sure that we got the right answer and maybe "
to compare and contrast a little bit. 
Let's do it the traditional way. 
Nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine. 
"So the standard way of doing it, I like to do all my "
borrowing before I do any of my subtraction so that I can stay 
"in my borrowing mode, or you can think of it as regrouping. "
"So I look at all of my numbers on top and see, are they all "
larger than the numbers on the bottom? 
And I start here at the right. 
"Six is definitely not larger than nine, so I have to borrow. "
"So I'll borrow ten or I'll borrow one from the tens place, "
which ends up being ten. 
So the six becomes a sixteen and then the five becomes a four. 
Then I go to the tens place. 
"Four needs to be larger than eight, so let me borrow one "
from the hundreds place. 
So then that four becomes a fourteen or fourteen tens because 
we're in the tens place. 
And then this four becomes a three. 
"Now these two columns or places look good, but right here I "
"have a three, which is less than a five. "
"Not cool, so I have to borrow again. "
That three becomes a thirteen and then that nine becomes an eight. 
And now I'm ready to subtract. 
So you get sixteen minus nine is seven. 
Fourteen minus eight is six. 
Thirteen minus five is eight. 
Eight minus seven is one. 
"And lucky for us, we got the right answer. "
I want to make it very clear. 
There's no better way to do this. 
This way is actually kind of longer and it takes up more 
"space on your paper than this way was, but this for me, "
is very hard to remember. 
It's very hard for me to keep track of what I borrowed and 
what the other number is and et cetera. 
"But here, at any point in time, I just have to "
remember two numbers. 
And the two numbers get simpler every step that I 
go through this process. 
So this is why I think that this is a little 
bit easier in my head. 
"But this might be, depending on the context, easier on paper. "
But at least here you didn't have to borrow or regroup. 
"Well, hopefully you find that a little bit useful. "
""
Where we left off in the last video 
the north has just won the Civil War. 
"Unfortunately for Abraham Lincoln, "
it was two months after he was assasinated; 
but now the North was dominant and essentially 
occupied the South. 
And we enter a period called reconstruction 
And reconstruction can refer to one of two things. 
And they're somewhat related. 
One is just the reconstruction from the war. 
"Obviously, there was a lot of damage done "
to both sides. 
But it's usually refered to the actual reconstruction to the south 
"and to some degree, kind of the reform of the south. "
"And I'm gonna glaze over lot of details, "
"like I did in the last video, and I might "
ignore some major events that might have been important 
but don't worry i'll get back to them 
but the three big things that happened during reconstructions 
other than the fact that the north were occupying the south 
and essensially to a large degree suspending democracy in the south 
and installing its own pollititions and its own law makers 
is that the United States passed the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth ammendments 
these are nown as the reconstructions ammendments. 
and in 1865 you have the thirteenth ammendment 
and this abolished slavery 
ended slavery 
we talked about the emancipation proclomation 
and that was essentially Abraham Lincoln's exacutive orders 
this was the speach he made but now it became an official law 
in 1865 
but in 1868 you have the fourteenth ammendment 
which made everyone - ever person- born in the United States 
a citizen and this includes the free slaves 
so its kind of like the slaves are now free and they are also citizens 
and in 1870 you have the fifteenth ammendment which gave all 
free men the right to vote 
and obviously now all men were free 
so the right to vote 
and I emphasize the MEN because even at this point 
women did not have the right to vote 
the right to vote 
and the fourteenth ammendment also introduced the 
"due process which i wont go into details here, "
"but it essentially said ""look the government has to go "
under a due process or 
where essentially it has its its 
subject to its own laws when determining 
whether it can take away property from or in some 
"way incurr, I guess, in some way infringe on rights of other people but we'll talk, we'll probably do "
a whole video on that 
but these were the real take aways so it really brought the 
"former slaves, at least by law, by these ammendments on equal "
standing. but we know that in practice that didn't happen. And you go fastforwards to 
1877 and you essentially have the Reconstruction 
"period formally ending, the occupation of the South formally ends and as soon "
as the occupation of the South formally ends you essentially 
and Democracy comes about you have a bunch of people coming to power and at this point of time the Republicans 
"were essentially, the North and these were the people who were kind of anti-slavery and you know, Abraham "
Lincoln was Republican and the Democrats come to power in the South and we can talk about how the different 
perceptions of the different parties change over time but at this point as soon as the occupation ended 
and to a large degree and you know I put Democracy in quotes because even in this period the North had essentaily 
"not occupied it anymore but the elections--these were things that were heavily contested, you have both "
sides of them kind of exerting force and in particular you have the Jim Crow Laws being passed in the 
"South and they're called ""Jim Crow"" based on this parody of the early 1800s. It was a practice for white "
men in the South at this time were even well before this in order to parody blacks they would paint their 
face black and they would act silly and all of this. Jim Crow was the name of one of these characters 
that was protrayed in the early 1800s--I think Jumping Jim Crow was the name--so that's where the laws 
"come from, but the Jim Crow laws essentially segregated blacks and whites in the South and even though "
"the idea might have been that they were equal, the reality were that the conditions for blacks--the places "
"that they were separated to--were far inferior. They had to use separate drinking fountains, they had "
"to use separate bathrooms, they couldn't sit in the same parts of theaters or in the same parts of buses. "
"And these lasted all the way until the Civil Rights Movement--all the way to the 1960s. Now, at the same "
"time that all of this was happening, you kinda had this post-war, this post-Civil War boom in the econom, "
where you hadthis kind of massive building of the railroads and steam engines and you know...to some 
"degree it was the First--well, I don't want to say the first, there was kind of many- there was kind "
of many ages of mass inovation--but all of these things tend to lead to a little bit of a bubble. And 
"then in 1873, what you have happening is a lot of the governments of the world start to go off of the "
gold and silver standard and they go to the gold standard. And what that happens is that anyone left 
"on the silver standard or partially both, the gold and silver standard, their currency would de-value, "
"and back then it was known as an unbalanced negative for your currency to de-value, we can later talk "
"about that... and so the US decides to follow and the big, the big actor here was Germany that decided "
to go off of the silver standards and go on the pure gold standard. And so the US decided to follow suit 
"with the Coinage Act, in 1873, but this leads to a huge--they called the Panic of 1870, theres a couple "
"of things here. One, it completely demolishes the price of silver, although it was happening on a normal "
basis. It hurts the silver miners and the industries associated with the silver miners--but I guess more 
"importantly, it restricts the money supply, now I won't go into all of the economic stuff. When you restrict "
"the money supply, you essentially increase interest rates and it essentially pops the bubble that was "
"forming, due to the railroads and all of the booming business and then you essentially have the US entering "
a depressionand that depression last from 1873 (when the Coinage Act and the bubble burst) all the way 
to 1879 but lucky for the United States after that time period 
After it recovered from the depression (at a super fast rate) in one of the fastest economic 
growths in US history 
You had this huge influx of immigrants 
Tens of millions from Europe and by 1890 the United States was 
now the richest country in the world on a per capita basis 
which was amazing! Because only 100 years ago it was kind of this colony of Great Britain 
or part of the British Empire 
It was kind of this thing that the European powers did not view as having relevance to them 
but now it was the richest country in the world 
And then you fast forward to 1898 and it starts to essentially become 
a bit of an empire 
Until this time the United States kind of kept to itself it wasn't really interested in 
controlling other nations or other people 
But in 1898 you had this constant (Until 1898 Cuba was a Spanish colony 
and there had been many revolts tried against the Spanish by the Cubans 
and the United States was fairly sympathetic to the Cubans plight 
They were another country in the New world trying to hold their own against a European power 
and the Spanish were fairly infamous for cracking down on their subjects pretty hard 
and so in 1898 during the revolt against the Spanish the US sent some 
ships over to Havana harbour to essentially protect American interests 
This might resonate a little bit to the Mexican American War where we kind of sent things close to 
another country to protect our own interests and make sure that nothing outrageous occurs 
While in Havana Harbour you have an American battleship called the Maine 
That explodes and sinks 
and this is an actual picture of it 
This is fun because we are entering the point in history when pictures start to become relevant 
although even in the mid eighteen sixties you had pictures 
That's a picture of Abraham Lincoln 
"The Maine gets sunk, the people who want to declare war on Spain "
say Hey Spain must have blown up the Maine (although this is still a complete mystery on the actual cause; 
"some say that it was a random explosion, some even cite conspiracies that would allow the US to justify "
entering the war while some say that Spain did it for whatever reason 
It did not like this American fleet in Havana Harbour) 
Regardless to say after it happened it made the Amercian public angry 
The American government angry and they declared a very short lived war on Spain 
They won prettyhandedly 
The big takeaway from the Spanish-American War is that the US essentially became and empire 
and started to have control of othe countries 
"Such as its temporary control of Cuba, it also (because it won) it got control of Guam which is right "
over there 
It still has control of Guam 
It also got control of the Phillipines from Spain 
and it maintained control of the Phillipines until the end of World War II 
It also got control of Puerto Rico which is still part of the US though not as an offical state 
it is US territory 
At this point the US becomes an empire and then you fast forward ot 1914 war breaks out in Europe 
I need to do a whole series fo videos on World War One 
"But war breaks out in Europe, particularly the two strongest powers that are really at each other in "
this time period are the British Empire and Germany 
You have this situation where the US is trying its hardest to avoid war and sustain neutrality 
Obviously the American people were predominantly of English decsent and were from English speaking countries 
So there were some sympathies for the British Empire for Great Britain 
"But they wanted to stay neutral, however what happened was that the British had a blockade of the Germans "
They had a kind of stranglehold. The Germans wanted to have a blockade of the British 
"As Great Britain was an island, it oculd really maybe win the war because it could somehow strangle the "
"island, if it could blockade the island. But unfortunately for Germany "
it did not have a navy that was as strong 
"So you get close to 1917 actually 1915,16,17 "
Germany starts to get desperate so it sends its submarines (U-boats) into the Atlantic 
So they say that if we cannot blockade Great Britain we can at least start harrasing or even blowing 
ships up that are trying to trade with Great Britain in order to create fear 
and have the equivalent of a blockade 
At first Germany does some minor things. 
As the war goes on however it becomes more and more desperate 
"and it starts to attack civilian ships, cruise liners, American starts dying becasue these "
U-boats are just willy-nilly torpedoeing ships 
The US doesn't tolerate this anymore and after the Zimmerman Telegram they enter the war 
in 1917 
Germany did not take the US that seriously at that point but they learned that they should have 
And then you fast forward to 1918 when the US was definetly one of the major powers 
They really turned the tide and become a large power after their involvment in the war. 
And then you fast forward to 1918 and the war ends 
And the real takeaway from this is that it ended some of the nations that were on the losing end 
Austria and Hungary no longer stayed a nation 
The Ottoman Empire was no longer a nation in this form 
As we will learn later there were huge reparations by the victors on Germany 
That to a large degree may have lead to World War Two 
The other things that started to happen at this point in 1920 you have the 18th and the 19th 
ammendments being passed 
The 18th enacted prohibition where all of a sudden you made 
alcohol illegal in the US. And the irony of this is that this is when you have all of these movies 
about bootleggers and this whole crime scene that develops around illegal alcohol 
The 19th ammendment was a little less controversial. It finally gave women the right to vote 
And one of the arguments against women having the right to vote was 
only men are fighting for the country and only they have the right to vote and be soldiers 
But during World War One worldwide so many men were fighting that women had to take up the slack at a 
domestic level and in essence they had to become a big part of the war effort in terms of 
working in the factories and producing things 
and so that was probably one of the things that on a global scale women started to attain the right to 
vote. Also during this period in the 1920's you have another post-war economic boom 
that really develops into a post-war economic bubble until 1929 
and then you have the stock market crash and I think some of us know that after that period 
The Great Depression Ensues 
It was a global great depression that contiues all the way until the US enters world was II

"When it comes to stories, probably we allgot started on fantasy, with fairy tales. "
So what better place than that to startour course in fantasy and science fiction. 
"Before you read Grimm's Fairy Tales, I'dlike to make a few comments to you. First "
"of all, I'd like to recommend an addition.Now, the Grimm Brothers wrote hundreds of "
tales. I'm not asking you to read all ofthem. What I'd like you to read is the 
selection in the Lucy Crane translation of1886. I would like you to do that for two 
"reasons. First of all, it's an goodcollection. It's shorter than the whole "
collection and it has almost every talethat you have probably encountered and all 
but one of the tales that I would like totalk with you about. The second reason 
"that I recommend that edition, is thatit's illustrated by her husband, Walter "
Crane. Now Walter Crane is a veryinteresting figure. He wrote the very 
first book on why we illustrate books atall. And so if we are going to examine 
fantasy and see how it may have peer notonly in the stories but in other domains 
like images. This would be an ideal way togo. Now you may already have a copy of 
"Grimm's Fairytales, If you do, I ask youto go online to project Gutenberg, take a "
look at the HTML version of the Lucy Cranetranslation. If you want to have it 
"online, you can read it there and it hasthe illustrations right in the text. If "
"you don't want to read it online, you canbuy a copy or you can read other versions "
and just read the stories that are in theone that you see online. A second reason 
"though, even beyond the selection and thewonderful coincidence of having the "
"husband and wife work on this booktogether, is that we are dealing here with "
a translation. And so it will be easierfor us if we're all using the same 
"translation. Not essential, not essentialbut easier. Now, fairy tales are in every "
culture. They're even in our language. Ihad an idea. It was a wonderful idea. I 
"was so excited about it and I said to myfriend, you know, I think I'm going to do. "
"And as soon as I finis hed explaining it,my friend said, you're out of your mind. "
That's just a fairy tale. We use the wordfairy tale in a dismissive sense as if it 
"referred to something impossible. And yet,sometimes when two people get married, we "
"in the audience turn to each other andsay, my goodness! It's a fairytale "
wedding. So we use that very same term asif it's something extraordinary and 
desirable. Fairy tales infect ourlanguage. They infect our thinking. They 
"are in every culture, and so in a sense wemight think of them, and it turns out that "
"this is correct, as a human universal. Theideal fairy tale, then, would be something "
oral. Something that yourgreat-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent 
"has passed down on to you. But, in fact,the Grimm Brothers tales were written by "
two brothers in nineteenth centuryGermany. Who wrote them for their own 
"reasons. What those reasons were we'lldiscuss later in this unit, but as you "
"read Grim's Fairytales, I'd like you tothink. What's the difference between this "
and what it might have been if it had beentruly oral? Are these really works that 
"speak to humanity, or are these somethingquite special? And even if they are quite "
"special, what's that underlying nuggetthat gives these fantasies the power to "
stay in our mind forever?

Write a polynomial to express the total value of p $20
"bills, q $10 bills, and r $5 bills."
So what's the value of p $20 bills?
"Well if I have p $20 bills, the value of each of those"
dollar bills is going to be $20.
So the value all p of them is going to be 20p.
"If I have one $20 bill, it's $20."
"If I have three $20 bills, if p is 3, it's going to be $60."
"Actually, let me do that in the same color as"
I underlined it.
I underlined it in yellow.
So let me do the p $20 bills.
So 20p is the p $20 bills.
Then you have your q $10 bills.
So what's the value of those?
Well it's going to be 10q.
"If I have one $10 bill, it's worth $10."
"If I have ten $10 bills, if q is 10, this is going to be"
worth 10 times 10. $100.
"And then finally you have your r $5 bills, which are going to"
be worth 5r dollars.
"One $5 bill, worth $5."
"Two $5 bills, worth $10."
And we're done.
We've expressed it as a polynomial.
Polynomial just means that we have multiple terms here and
this is three terms. We could even call it a trinomial.

"I'll even write down the word, 'picking'."
"how many meet our constraints, satisfy this event?"
And how many possible outcomes are there?
"So let me write the possible outcomes right over here,"
so possible outcomes.
And you'll see it's actually a very straight forward idea.
So the set of all the possible outcomes:
that yellow marble or that yellow marble.
There's two red marbles in the bag.
"So I could pick that red marble, or that red marble."
"So I could pick that green marble, or that green marble."
And then there's one blue marble in the bag.
"sample...the set of all the possible outcomes,"
fancy word for just a simple idea.
There's eight possible things that I can do.
"So when I think of the probability of picking a yellow marble,"
"I want to think about, well what are all the possibilities?"
"Well, there's eight possibilities for my trial."
"So the number of possible outcomes,"
"you could view it as the size of the sample space,"
look I have eight marbles.
"And you say how many of those marbles meet my constraint,"
that satisfy this event here?
"Well, there's three marbles that satisfy my event."
There's three outcomes that will allow this event to occur.
I guess this is one way to say it.
So there're three right over here.
"If I say what is the probability of picking a yellow marble,"
well how many different types of marbles can I pick?
Well there's eight different marbles I could pick
And then how many are yellow?
"Well, there's three of them that are actually yellow."

"Hey, how're you doing? Justin here again, coming at you "
this time for a D minor. 
"Now, the other two minors were pretty easy: the A minor was "
very similar to an E and an E minor was an E with a finger lifted off. 
"So, D going to be really simple as well? "
Do I get into this D minor? 
"Unfortunately not. It's not a particularly hard chord, "
it's not the big dreaded F chord that everyone dislikes. 
But it requires a little bit of a kind of awkward 
finger stretch for some people. 
"I didn't find this one too bad, "
I had a lot more trouble with G chord when I was learning guitar. 
But a lot of people struggle with Dmin. 
So I'm going to show you a couple of little variations around it as well. 
"So, let's go to a close-up and check out this new chord. "
"Okay, here we are, looking at the D minor. Now, doesn't look too bad, does it? "
I know what you're thinking. You're thinking 
"""Justin just said it was going to be a bit difficult and that "
"doesn't look that hard"". "
"Well, it is that hard. "
"Now, you can see here, "
the third finger has got to stretch 
"and it's fingers one, two and three. "
"Now, for a lot of people, that's a little bit difficult. "
"I don't find it that hard now, and some people find that they angle their fingers a little bit like that, "
"which is kind of okay, "
"but I think you're better off trying to get it a little bit squarer on this one, for now. "
"So what we've got here, let's start off with the usual: "
"first finger, first string, first fret. "
"Second finger, second fret, third string, "
"and third finger has to move, you can see there, just the "
"way my fingers had to go from here and then go out, "
it's going to the third fret of the second string. 
"And it's that third finger that causes a lot of people problems, trying to play this chord. "
"If that's you and you really struggle with this chord, "
the other fingering option is to use the fourth finger. 
Which I must admit that was the way I played Dm 
"for a long time, using fingers one, two and four. "
It really doesn't make very much difference whether 
"you use your third or your fourth. I prefer using my third these days, "
mainly because I can use a little chord trick called a suspended chord. 
In a slightly more advanced lesson. 
"So I think fingers one, two and three are better, "
"if you can stretch it. But if you can't, you can always go for whacking "
the old fourth finger down there. 
"Now, when it comes to playing it, "
"of course if you look at the chord diagram, "
you'll notice that you shouldn't touch the thickest two strings. 
"So starting at the fourth string, you should do your strum "
. . . 
pick out the notes one at a time 
. . . 
"Those three should be pretty straight forward, "
. . . 
"It's usually this last note, the thinnest string, "
it just sounds like this for people: 
. . . 
"And all again, it's the third finger lying down too much. "
"As soon as you lift it back up a little bit, "
. . . 
You'll find that that's what'll give you that nice roundness 
in your fingers and it'll allow you to get that note. 
"Which is the note F, actually. "
. . . 
"Here, on your D minor chord. "
"It is a really, really good chord, D minor, "
"and even if it does feel a little bit stretchy, "
"nearly everything that you do that's new, "
that's a little bit hard is going to be stretchy. 
And it's just a matter of getting used to it. 
"Especially for the next stage, we've got G and C, "
"which are again, even stretchier. "
But one thing that can help with these chords 
that have got a little bit of a stretch 
is to think to rotate your hand outwards. 
"So if you've got your hand flat like this, "
"is to think of your thumb down toward the ground, "
"so as you're doing it, "
try and think that you're pushing this part of your hand 
up toward the guitar neck a bit more. 
That can often help with the stretch. 
"If it's too long like this, feels a bit too, "
"see your third finger is going to be a bit long there, "
"so by doing that, "
it helps curl up those fingers 
and gets them in a good position. 
"So, that might be something to think about there as well. "
"So, have fun with your D minor. "
Now we're going to try to put them together.

What I want to do in this video is try to understand how
two proteins can interact with each other in conjunction with
ATP to actually produce mechanical motion.
"And the reason why I want to do this-- one, it occurs"
"outside of muscle cells as well, but this is really going"
to be the first video on really how muscles work.
And then we'll talk about how nerves actually stimulate
muscles to work.
So it'll all build up from this video.
So what I've done here is I've copy and pasted two images of
proteins from Wikipedia.
This is myosin.
They're interwound around each other so you can see it's this
"very complex looking protein or enzyme, however you want to"
I'll tell you why it's called an enzyme-- because it
actually helps react ATP into ADP and phosphate groups.
So that's why it's called an ATPase.
It's a subclass of the ATPase enzymes.
This right here is actin.
What we're going to see in this video is how myosin
essentially uses the ATP to essentially crawl along.
You can almost view it as an actin rope and that's what
So let me draw it.
I'll actually draw it on this actin right here.
So let's say we have one of these myosin heads.
"So when I say a myosin head, this is one of the myosin"
"heads right here and then it's connected, it's interwound,"
it's woven around.
This is the other one and it winds around that way.
Now let's just say we're just dealing with one
of the myosin heads.
Let's say it's in this position.
Let me see how well I can draw it.
Let's say it starts off in a position that looks like that
and then this is kind of the tail part that connects to
some other structural and we'll talk about that in more
"detail, but this is my myosin head right there in its"
"starting position, not doing anything."
"Now, ATP can come along and bond to this myosin head, this"
"enzyme, this protein, this ATPase enzyme."
So let me draw some ATP.
So ATP comes along and bonds to this guy right here.
Let's say that's the-- and it's not going to be this big
"relative to the protein, but this is just to"
give you the idea.
So soon as the ATP binds to its appropriate site on this
"enzyme or protein, the enzyme, it detaches from the actin."
So let me write this down.
"So one, ATP binds to myosin head and as soon as that"
"happens, that causes the myosin to release actin."
So that's step one.
"So I start it off with this guy just touching the actin,"
"the ATP comes, and it gets released."
"So in the next step-- so after that step, it's going to look"
something like this-- and I want to draw
it in the same place.
"After the next step, it's going to look"
something like this.
It will have released.
attached to it still.
I know it might be a little bit convoluted when I keep
"writing over the same thing, but you have the"
ATP attached to it.
"Now the next step-- the ATP hydrolizes, the phosphate gets"
pulled off of it.
This is an ATPase enzyme.
That's what it does.
Let me write that down.
this myosin protein into kind of a high energy state.
So let me do step two.
This thing-- it gets hydrolized.
We know that ATP is the energy currency of biological
systems. So it releases energy.
"I'm drawing it as a little spark or explosion, but you"
can really imagine it's changing the confirmation of--
it kind of spring-loads this protein right here to go into
a state so it's ready to crawl along the myosin.
"So in step two-- plus energy, energy and then this-- you can"
enzyme to high energy.
"You can imagine it winds the spring, or loads the spring."
So step two-- what happens is the phosphate group gets--
"they're still attached, but it gets detached from"
the rest of the ATP.
So that becomes ADP and that energy changes the
confirmation so that this protein now goes into a
position that looks like this.
So this is where we end up at the end of step two.
Let me make sure I do it right.
something like this.
something like this.
This is in its cocked position.
It has a lot of energy right now.
It's wound up in this position.
You still have your ADP.
You still have your-- that's your adenosine and let's say
you have your two phosphate groups on the ADP and you
still have one phosphate group right there.
"Now, when that phosphate group releases-- so let me write"
this as step three.
"Remember, when we started, we were just sitting here."
"The ATP binds on step one-- actually, it does definitely"
"bind, at the end of step one, that causes the myosin protein"
to get released.
"Then after step one, we naturally have step two."
The ATP hydrolyzes into ADP phosphate.
That releases energy and that allows the myosin protein to
get cocked into this high energy position and kind of
"attach, you can think of it, to the next rung"
Now we're in a high energy state.
"In step three, the phosphate releases."
The phosphate is released from myosin in step three.
That's a phosphate group being released.
"And what this does is, this releases that energy of that"
to push on the actin.
"This is the power stroke, if you imagine in an engine."
This is what's causing the mechanical movement.
"So when the phosphate group is actually released-- remember,"
the original release is when you take
ATP to ADP in a phosphate.
That put it in this spring-loaded position.
So you could view this as the power stroke.
We're actually creating mechanical energy.
So depending on which one you want to view as fixed-- if you
"view the actin as fixed, whatever myosin is attached to"
it would move to the left.
"If you imagine the myosin being fixed, the actin and"
"whatever it's attached to would move to the right,"
either way.
But this is where we fundamentally
get the muscle action.
And then step four-- you have the ADP released.
"one, except we're just one rung further to the left on"
the actin molecule.
"So to me, this is pretty amazing."
We actually are seeing how ATP energy can be used to-- we're
going from chemical energy or bond energy in ATP to
"For me, that's amazing because when I first learned about"
"ATP-- people say, you use ATP to do everything in your cells"
and contract muscles.
"Well, gee, how do you go from bond energy to actually"
"contracting things, to actually doing what we see in"
our everyday world as mechanical energy?
And this is really where it all occurs.
This is really the core issue that's going on here.
"And you have to say, well, gee, how this thing change"
shape and all that?
"And you have to remember, these proteins, based on"
what's bonded to it and what's not bonded to
"it, they change shape."
"And some of those shapes take more energy to attain, and"
"then if you do the right things, that energy can be"
released and then it can push another protein.
But I find this just fascinating.
And now we can build up from this actin and myosin
interactions to understand how muscles actually work.
